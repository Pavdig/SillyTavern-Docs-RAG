# Development and Automation

SillyTavern's default package only provides a barebones platform that can be extended in a multitude of ways.

**STscript**

STscript is a powerful scripting language based on batched chat commands that can be approached without any prior coding knowledge.

**Function Calling**

Add more dynamic capabilities by letting the LLM use external sources of data or trigger specific functionality of the extension.

**UI Extensions**

UI extensions run in a browser environment and expand the functionality of SillyTavern by hooking into its events and API.

**Server Plugins**

Server plugins allow adding functionality such as new API endpoints by running code in the NodeJS environment.

**Internationalization (i18n)**

Learn how to translate SillTavern's UI into your language.
