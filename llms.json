    "content": "# What is SillyTavern?\n\nSillyTavern (or ST for short) is a locally installed user interface that allows you to interact with text generation LLMs, image generation engines, and TTS voice models. Our goal is to empower users with as much utility and control over their LLM prompts as possible, embracing the steep learning curve as part of the fun.\n\nSillyTavern is a passion project brought to you by a dedicated community of LLM enthusiasts and will always be free and open-sourced. Beginning in February 2023 as a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8, SillyTavern now has over 200 contributors and 2 years of independent development under its belt, and continues to serve as a leading software for savvy AI hobbyists.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n|   [](/static/screenshot1.jpg)    |  [](/static/screenshot2.jpg)   |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| [](/static/screenshot3.jpg) | [](/static/screenshot4.jpg) |\n\n## Installation Requirements\n\nThe hardware requirements are minimal: it will run on anything that can run NodeJS 18 or higher. If you intend to do LLM inference on your local machine, we recommend a 3000-series NVIDIA graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM.\n\nFollow the installation guide for your platform:\n\n* [Windows](SillyTavern_Installation_Windows.md)\n* [Linux and Mac](SillyTavern_Installation_LinuxMacOS.md)\n* [Android](SillyTavern_Installation_Android.md)\n* [Docker](SillyTavern_Installation_Docker.md)\n\n## Branches\n\nSillyTavern is being developed using a two-branch system to ensure a smooth experience for all users.\n\n* `release` -\ud83c\udf1f **Recommended for most users.** This is the most stable and recommended branch, updated only when major releases are pushed. It's suitable for the majority of users. Typically updated once a month.\n* `staging` - \u26a0\ufe0f **Not recommended for casual use.** This branch has the latest features, but be cautious as it may break at any time. Only for power users and enthusiasts. Updates several times daily.\n\n## What do I need other than SillyTavern?\n\nSince SillyTavern is only an interface, you will need access to an LLM backend to provide inference. You can use AI Horde for instant out-of-the-box chatting. Aside from that, we support many other local and cloud-based LLM backends: OpenAI-compatible API, KoboldAI, Tabby, and many more. You can read more about our supported APIs in the [API Connections](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_index.md) section.\n\n## Character Cards\n\nSillyTavern is built around the concept of \"character cards\". A character card is a collection of prompts that set the behavior of the LLM and is required to have persistent conversations in SillyTavern. They function similarly to ChatGPT's GPTs or Poe's bots. The content of a character card can be anything: an abstract scenario, an assistant tailored for a specific task, a famous personality or a fictional character.\n\nTo have a quick conversation without selecting a character card or to just test the LLM connection, simply type your prompt input into the input bar on the [Welcome Screen](SillyTavern_Usage_welcome-assistants.md) after opening SillyTavern. This will create an empty \"Assistant\" character card that you can customize later.\n\nTo get a general idea on how to define character cards, see the default character (Seraphina) or download selected community-made cards from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu.\n\nYou can also create your own character cards from scratch. Refer to the [Character Design](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) guide for more information.\n\n## Key Features\n\n* Advanced [text generation settings](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) with many community-made presets\n* [World Info support](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md): create rich lore or save tokens on your character card\n* [Group chats](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_groupchats.md): multi-bot rooms for characters to talk to you and/or each other\n* [Rich UI customization options](SillyTavern_Usage_User_Settings_uicustomization.md): theme colors, background images, custom CSS, and more\n* [User personas](SillyTavern_Usage_personas.md): let the AI know a bit about you for greater immersion\n* [Built-in RAG support](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_data-bank.md): add documents to your chats for the AI to reference\n* Extensive [chat commands](SillyTavern_Usage_Chatting_slashcommands.md) subsystem and own [scripting engine](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md)\n\n## Extensions\n\nSillyTavern has extensibility support.\n\n* [Character emotional expressions (sprites)](SillyTavern_extensions_Expression-Images.md)\n* [Auto-Summary of the chat history](SillyTavern_extensions_Summarize.md)\n* Automatic UI and [chat translation](SillyTavern_extensions_Translation.md)\n* [Stable Diffusion/FLUX/DALL-E image generation](SillyTavern_extensions_Stable-Diffusion.md)\n* [Text-to-speech for AI response messages](SillyTavern_extensions_TTS.md)\n* [Web Search capabilities for adding additional real world context to your prompts](SillyTavern_extensions_WebSearch.md)\n* Many more are available to download from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu.\n\n## How can I get in touch with the developers directly?\n\n* Discord: cohee, rossascends, wolfsblvt\n* Reddit: /u/RossAscends (https://www.reddit.com/user/RossAscends/), /u/sillylossy (https://www.reddit.com/user/sillylossy/), u/Wolfsblvt (https://www.reddit.com/user/Wolfsblvt/)\n* Post a GitHub issue (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/issues)\n\n## I like your project!

    "content": "# Extras Installation\n\nThis page contains instructions for installing SillyTavern Extras on your local device.\n\n**Discontinued**\n\nThe Extras project was discontinued in April 2024 and won't receive any new updates or modules. The vast majority of modules are available natively in the main SillyTavern application. You may still install and use it but don't expect to get immediate support if you face any issues.\n\n**Local installation of Extras can be difficult or impossible on your OS (especially Termux).**\n\n## Use the Official Extras Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/github/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/colab/GPU.ipynb)\n\n* Simple to setup\n* Free to use\n* No Colab GPU credits required (use the `use_cpu` options)\n* See the [Colab Guide Page](SillyTavern_extensions_Extras_Installation.md) for details.\n\n### Running Extras in Colab\n\n* Open the Official Extras Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/github/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/colab/GPU.ipynb)\n* Select the desired \"Extra\" options\n* select `use_cpu` to run Extras without requiring GPU credit\n  * this will make Stable Diffusion slower, but everything else will run normally\n* Not required, but recommended: select the `secure` option to generate the API key to protect your shared instance.\n* Click the Start button on the left (looks like a triangle 'play' button)\n* Wait for it to finish loading everything\n* Look for the `trycloudflare.com` link at the bottom of the output. Ignore the localhost link, it won't work (we tried!).\n* It will start with the text `Running on`\n* Copy the API URL link that is listed under that line. (**DO NOT copy the 'localhost' URL, use the other one**)\n* Start SillyTavern with extensions support: (set `enableExtensions` to `true` in your `config.yaml` if necessary)\n* Navigate to SillyTavern's Extensions menu (click the 'stacked blocks' icon at the top of the page).\n* Paste the API URL into the box at the top. (**NOT the API Key box**)\n* If you have NOT enabled the `secure` option, make sure the API Key box is completely empty when using the official colab.\n* If you have enabled the `secure` option, paste the generated API key into the API Key box.\n* API key will appear in the colab's console output, for example: `Your API key is fee2f3f559`\n* Click \"Connect\"\n\n---\n\n## Local Installation Methods\n\n### MiniConda (recommended)\n\nThis method is recommended because Conda makes a 'virtual environment' for the Extras requirement packages to live inside, so they do not affect your system-wide Python setup.\n\n1. Install Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n\n    _(Important!) Read how to use Conda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)_\n\n2. Install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n\n    _(Chads who installed SillyTavern with git to begin with can skip this step!)_\n    \n    After you have both of them installed...\n    \n    Type/paste the commands below `ONE BY ONE` IN THE `CONDA COMMAND PROMPT WINDOW` and hit `Enter` after each one.\n\n3. Create a new Conda environment (let's call it `extras`):\n\n    `conda create -n extras`\n\n4. Activate the new environment\n\n    `conda activate extras` (you should see `(extras)` pop up on the left side of your command prompt)\n\n5. Install the required system packages (this will take some time)\n\n    `conda install python=3.11 git`\n\n6. Clone the Extras GitHub repo\n\n    `git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-extras`\n\n7. Navigate to your cloned Extras repo\n\n    `cd SillyTavern-extras`\n\n8. Install Extras' requirements by using **one** of the following commands (will take time, again):\n\n   * `pip install -r requirements.txt` - for basic features\n   * `pip install -r requirements-rvc.txt` - for real-time voice cloning\n   * `pip install -r requirements-coqui.txt` - for Coqui TTS (not recommended)\n\n    See the [Common Problems](SillyTavern_extensions_Extras_Installation.md) page if you get errors at this step!\n\n9. See below 'Running Extras After Install'\n\n---\n\n### System-Wide Installation\n\nThis is easier, but will affect your system-wide Python installation.\n\nThis can cause conflicts if you work with many Python programs that have different requirements.\n\nIf this is your first time touching anything Python-related, that should not be a problem.\n\n1. Install Python 3.11: <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/>\n2. Install git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>\n3. Open a command prompt window and go to a folder in which you have complete access permissions.\n4. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-extras`, hit Enter.\n5. After the clone has finished, type `cd SillyTavern-extras`, hit Enter.\n6. Type `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n7. See below 'Running Extras After Install'\n\n---\n\n## Running Extras After Install\n\n### Confirm extensions are enabled\n\n1. Open the file called `config.yaml`in a text editor. The file is located in ST's base install folder.\n2. Look for the line that reads `enableExtensions`.\n3. Make sure that line has `true`, and not `false`.\n\n### Decide which module to use\n\n(This only needs to be done once)\n\n* Extras is always started with a Python command line.\n* `python server.py` is the bare minimum, but it does not enable any useful modules.\n* to enable modules you must use the `--enable-modules=` modifier, with a comma-separated list of module names\n\nExample: `python server.py --enable-modules=caption,summarize,classify`\n\nThis would enable Image Captioning, Chat Summary, and live updating Character Expressions.\n\nBelow is a table that describes each module.\n\n| Name         | Description                                                         |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `caption`    | Image captioning                                                    |\n| `summarize`  | Text summarization                                                  |\n| `classify`   | Text sentiment classification                                       |\n| `sd`         | Stable Diffusion image generation                                   |\n| `silero-tts` | Silero TTS server (https://github.com/ouoertheo/silero-api-server) |\n| `edge-tts`   | Microsoft Edge TTS client (https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts)      |\n| `chromadb`   | Vector storage server                                               |\n| `coqui-tts`  | Coqui TTS                                                           |\n| `rvc`        | Real-time voice cloning                                             |\n\n* Decide which modules you want to add to your Python command line.\n* They will be used in the next step.\n\n**NOTE: There must be `no spaces at all in your Python command's module list!`**\n\n### Start Extras Server\n\nWhile still in your command prompt window inside the Extras installation folder...\n\n1. Make sure your conda environment is active (if you used the Conda install method)\n2. Type `activate extras` if the environment is not active.\n3. Type `python server.py --enable-modules=YOUR,SELECTED,MODULE,LIST,HERE`\n4. The extras server will load.\n5. After a while it will show you a URL at the end. For local installs, this defaults to `http://localhost:5100`.\n6. Copy the API URL.\n\n### Connect ST to the Extras server\n\n1. Start your SillyTavern server, and view the SillyTavern interface in your browser.\n2. Open the Extensions panel (via the 'Stacked Blocks' icon at the top of the page)\n3. Paste the API URL into the input box.\n4. Click `Connect`.\n\nTo run Extras again, simply activate the environment and run these commands in a command prompt.\n\n`conda activate extras`, Hit Enter.\n`python server.py`, Hit Enter.\n\nBe sure to the additional options for server.py (see below) that your setup requires.\n\n## Make a .bat File for Easy Startup\n\nThis is Optional and only applies to Windows, but something similar should be possible on MacOS.\n\n1. View your Windows Desktop\n2. Right-click, select `New`, and then click `Text Document`\n3. A new file will appear on your Desktop, asking for a name.\n4. Name the file `STExtras.txt`\n5. Open the newly created file in a text editor.\n6. Paste the following code into it:\n\n    ```\n    cd C:\\_your_\\_full_\\_Extras_\\_folder_\\_path_\\\n    call conda activate extras\n    python server.py --enable-modules=YOUR,SELECTED,MODULE,LIST,HERE,WITH,NO,SPACES\n    call conda deactivate\n    pause\n    ```\n\n7. Replace the placeholder folder path with your actual Extras install folder path.\n8. Replace the python command line with your actual command line\n9. Save the file with a new name `STExtras.bat` (Use `File` >> `Save As` in most text editors)\n\nYou can now simply double-click on this .bat file to easily start Extras.\n\nIf you ever want to change the module list (or any other command line modifiers for the extras server), simply edit the python command inside the .bat file.\n\n## Extras Install Common Problems\n\nThis section lists common questions and problems encountered while installing SillyTavern Extras.\n\n### Error: Could not import the 'talkinghead' module on Linux\n\nIt requires the installation of an additional package because it's not installed automatically due to incompatibility with Colab. Run this after you install other requirements:\n\n`pip install wxpython`\n\n### Extras server can't connect to AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI\n\n> Could not connect to remote SD backend at <http://127.0.0.1:7860>! Disabling SD module...\n\n**Make sure webui-user.bat that you start Stable Diffusion with contains --api command line option in the COMMANDLINE_ARGS variable.**\n\nFind and replace that line in your \"webui-user.bat\": `set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--api`\n\nIf the API mode is disabled for SD Web UI, the Extras server won't be able to make a connection and you won't be able to generate images!\n\n#### Still doesn't work?\n\nEnsure that you start everything in the proper order, waiting for every program to finish loading before proceeding to the next step:\n\n1. Stable Diffusion Web UI\n2. SillyTavern Extras\n3. SillyTavern\n\nThe extras server can't reconnect to the Stable Diffusion API if it was loaded after.\n\n### hnswlib wheel building error when installing ChromaDB\n\n> ERROR: Could not build wheels for hnswlib, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects\n\nBefore installing the ChromaDB module you must first do `one of the following`:\n\n* Install Visual C++ build tools: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>\n* Install the `hnswlib` package with conda: `conda install -c conda-forge hnswlib`\n\n---\n\n### Error when installing Python requirements on Mac\n\n> ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==2.0.0+cu117\n\nMac does not support CUDA, so torch packages should be installed without CUDA support.\n\nInstall the requirements using the `requirements-silicon.txt` file instead.\n\n---\n\n### Missing modules?\n\n* You must specify a list of module names in your Python command line, with the `--enable-modules` modifier.\n* See [Modules](SillyTavern_extensions_Extras_Installation.md) section.\n\n---\n\n### What is the API Key box for?\n\n* The API Key box in SillyTavern's Extensions panel is only used when you have:\n  * created a text file named `api_key.txt` in your Extras install folder, which contains your chosen Extras 'password'.\n  * started extras with the `--secure` commandline argument.\n* This makes the Extras API 'password locked', so only users who have that key in their API Key box can access it.\n* This is mainly useful for people who want to make their own public deployment of Extras (colab, etc).\n* Users running Extras on their own PC for personal use should not type anything into the API Key box.\n\n### What about mobile/Android/Termux? \ud83e\udd14\n\n* There are some folks in the community having success running Extras on their phones via Ubuntu on Termux.\n* However, Extras were not made with mobile support in mind.\n* No support will be provided for people running Extras on their Android devices.\n* Direct all your questions to the creator of the guide linked below instead.\n\n#### \u2757 This is UNSUPPORTED\n\n<https://rentry.org/STAI-Termux#downloading-and-running-tai-extras>"

    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/installation/docker",
    "content": "# Docker Installation\n\n**These instructions assume you have installed Docker, are able to access your command line for the installation of containers, and familiar with their general operation.**\n\n**## Using the GitHub Container Registry**\n\nUsing a prebuilt image is the quickest and easiest way to get started with SillyTavern in Docker. You can pull the latest image from the GitHub Container Registry.\n\n### Docker Compose (recommended)\n\nDownload the `docker-compose.yml` file from the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/docker/docker-compose.yml) and run the following command in the directory where the file is located. This will pull the latest release image from the GitHub Container Registry and start the container, automatically creating the necessary volumes.\n\n```sh\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nYou can edit the file and apply additional customization to suit your needs:\n\n- The default port is 8000. You can change it by modifying the `ports` section.\n- Change the `image` tag to `staging` if you want to use the development branch instead of the stable release.\n- If you want to adjust the server configuration using environment variables, check the [Environment Variables](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md) page.\n\n### Docker CLI (advanced)\n\nYou will need two mandatory directory mappings and a port mapping to allow SillyTavern to function. In the command, replace your selections in the following places:\n\n#### Container Variables\n\n##### Volume Mappings\n\n- `CONFIG_PATH` - The directory where SillyTavern configuration files will be stored on your host machine\n- `DATA_PATH` - The directory where SillyTavern user data (including characters) will be stored on your host machine\n- `PLUGINS_PATH` - (optional) The directory where SillyTavern server plugins will be stored on your host machine\n- `EXTENSIONS_PATH` - (optional) The directory where global UI extensions will be stored on your host machine\n\n##### Port Mappings\n\n- `PUBLIC_PORT` - The port to expose the traffic on. This is mandatory, as you will be accessing the instance from outside of its virtual machine container. DO NOT expose this to the internet without implementing a separate service for security.\n\n##### Additional Settings\n\n- `SILLYTAVERN_VERSION` - On the GitHub Packages page (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/pkgs/container/sillytavern) you'll see the list of tagged image versions. The image tag \"latest\" will keep you up-to-date with the current release. You can also utilize \"staging\" that points to the nightly image of the respective branch.\n\n#### Running the container\n\n1. Open your Command Line\n2. Run the following command in a folder where you want to store the configuration and data files:\n\n```bash\nSILLYTAVERN_VERSION=\"latest\"\nPUBLIC_PORT=\"8000\"\nCONFIG_PATH=\"./config\"\nDATA_PATH=\"./data\"\nPLUGINS_PATH=\"./plugins\"\nEXTENSIONS_PATH=\"./extensions\"\n\ndocker run \\\n  --name=\"sillytavern\" \\\n  -p \"$PUBLIC_PORT:8000/tcp\" \\\n  -v \"$CONFIG_PATH:/home/node/app/config:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$DATA_PATH:/home/node/app/data:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$EXTENSIONS_PATH:/home/node/app/public/scripts/extensions/third-party:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$PLUGINS_PATH:/home/node/app/plugins:rw\" \\\n  ghcr.io/sillytavern/sillytavern:\"$SILLYTAVERN_VERSION\"\n```\n\nBy default the container will run in the foreground. If you want to run it in the background, add the `-d` flag to the `docker run` command.\n\n**## Building the Docker Image**\n\nThe following section assumes you installed SillyTavern in a non-root (non-admin) folder. If you installed SillyTavern in a root folder, you may have to run some of these commands with administrator rights [`sudo`, `doas`, Command Prompt (Administrator)].\n\n**If you want to build the Docker image yourself, you can do so by following these steps. This is useful if you want to customize the image or use it for development purposes.**\n\n### Linux\n\n1. Install Docker by following the Docker installation guide here (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n   **Do not** install Docker Desktop.\n\n**2. Follow the steps in **Manage Docker as a non-root user** in the Docker Post-Installation Guide (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).**\n\n3. Install Git (https://git-scm.com/download/linux) using your package manager.\n\n    - Debian (Ubuntu/Pop! OS/etc.)\n\n        ```sh\n        sudo apt install git\n        ```\n\n    - Arch Linux (Manjaro/EndeavourOS/etc.)\n\n        ```sh\n        sudo pacman -S git\n        ```\n\n    - Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), etc.\n        ```sh\n        sudo dnf install git\n        ```\n\n4. Clone the SillyTavern repository.\n\n    - Release (Stable Branch)\n\n        ```sh\n        git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern && cd SillyTavern/docker\n        ```\n\n    - Staging (Development Branch)\n        ```sh\n        git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b staging && cd SillyTavern/docker\n        ```\n\n5. Execute `docker compose` by running the following command within the Docker folder.\n\n    ```sh\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n\n6. Open a new browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (http://localhost:8000). You should see SillyTavern load in a few moments.\n\n### Windows\n\n**Regarding Docker on Windows**\n\nUsing Docker on Windows is **_really_** complicated. Not only do you need to activate _Windows Subsystem for Linux_ within _Turn Windows features on or off_, but also configure your system for Virtualization (Intel VT-d/AMD SVM) which differs from PC manufacturer to PC manufacturer (or motherboard manufacturer). Sometimes, this option is not present on some systems.\n\nIt is highly suggested you install SillyTavern by following our [Windows](SillyTavern_Installation_Windows.md) guide. This section is a _rough_ idea of how it can be done on Windows.\n\n**1.  Install Docker Desktop by following the Docker installation guide here (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/).**\n\n2.  Install Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win).\n3.  Clone the SillyTavern repository.\n\n    -   Release (Stable Branch)\n\n        ```sh\n        git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern && cd SillyTavern/docker\n        ```\n\n    -   Staging (Development Branch)\n        ```sh\n        git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b staging && cd SillyTavern/docker\n        ```\n\n4.  Execute `docker compose` by running the following command within the Docker folder.\n\n    ```sh\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n\n5.  Open a new browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (http://localhost:8000). You should see SillyTavern load in a few moments.\n\n### macOS\n\n**Even though macOS is similar to Linux, it doesn't have the Docker Engine. You will have to install Docker Desktop similarly to Windows.**\n\nYou will also need to install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) in order to install Git on your Mac. This section is a _rough_ idea on how it can be done on macOS.\n\n**1.  Install Docker Desktop by following the Docker installation guide here (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).**\n\n2.  Install `git` using Homebrew.\n\n    ```sh\n    brew install git\n    ```\n\n3.  Clone the SillyTavern repository.\n\n    -   Release (Stable Branch)\n\n        ```sh\n        git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern && cd SillyTavern/docker\n        ```\n\n    -   Staging (Development Branch)\n        ```sh\n        git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern -b staging && cd SillyTavern/docker\n        ```\n\n4.  Execute `docker compose` by running the following command within the Docker folder.\n\n    ```sh\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n\n5.  Open a new browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (http://localhost:8000). You should see SillyTavern load in a few moments.\n\n## Configuring SillyTavern\n\nSillyTavern's configuration file (config.yaml) will be located within the `config` folder. Configuring the config file should be no different than configuring it without Docker, however you will need to run `nano` or a code editor with administrator rights in order to save your changes.\n\nDon't forget to restart the Docker container for SillyTavern in order to apply your changes! Make sure you execute this command within the `docker` folder.\n\n```sh\ndocker compose restart sillytavern\n```\n\n**## Locating User Data**\n\nSillyTavern's data folder will be within the `data` folder. Backing up your files should be easy to do, however, restoring or adding content into it may require you to do so with administrator rights.\n\n## Running Server Plugins\n\nRunning plugins like HoYoWiki-Scraper-TS (https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/HoYoWiki-Scraper-TS) or SillyTavern-Fandom-Scraper (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Fandom-Scraper) within Docker is no different from running it on your system without Docker, however we will need to do a slight modification to the Docker Compose script in order to do so.\n\nIf you already see a _plugins_ folder within the `docker` folder, you can skip Steps 1-2.\n\n**1. Using `nano` or a code editor, open _docker-compose.yml_ and add the following line below `volumes`.**\n\n    ```sh\n        volumes:\n            - \"./config:/home/node/app/config\"\n            - \"./data:/home/node/app/data\"\n            - \"./plugins:/home/node/app/plugins\"\n    ```\n\n2. Create a new folder within the `docker` folder called _plugins_.\n3. Follow your plugin's instructions on installing the plugin.\n4. Using `nano` or a code editor with administrator rights, open _config.yaml_ (within the `config` folder) and enable `enableServerPlugins`\n\n    ```sh\n    enableServerPlugins: true\n    ```\n\n5. Restart the Docker container.\n\n    ```sh\n    docker compose restart sillytavern\n    ```\n\n## Non-root user mode\n\n**Staging Feature**\n\nThis is currently only available on the `staging` branch of SillyTavern, and not part of the latest release.\n\n**By default, the container runs as root. If you want files created in mounted volumes to be owned by a specific host user (for example, to avoid root-owned files), you can enable non-root mode.**\n\n### Option 1: PUID/PGID (recommended)\n\nSet `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables to the UID/GID you want the container to use. The entrypoint will update ownership of required directories and then run the server as the mapped user.\n\nDocker Compose example:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  sillytavern:\n    environment:\n      - PUID=1000\n      - PGID=1000\n```\n\nDocker CLI example:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n  --name=\"sillytavern\" \\\n  -e PUID=1000 \\\n  -e PGID=1000 \\\n  -p \"$PUBLIC_PORT:8000/tcp\" \\\n  -v \"$CONFIG_PATH:/home/node/app/config:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$DATA_PATH:/home/node/app/data:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$EXTENSIONS_PATH:/home/node/app/public/scripts/extensions/third-party:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$PLUGINS_PATH:/home/node/app/plugins:rw\" \\\n  ghcr.io/sillytavern/sillytavern:\"$SILLYTAVERN_VERSION\"\n```\n\n### Option 2: Docker `--user` flag\n\nYou can also run the container as a specific user with Docker's `--user` flag. In this mode, the container cannot automatically fix permissions, so ensure your mounted volumes are already writable by the UID/GID you provide.\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n  --name=\"sillytavern\" \\\n  --user 1000:1000 \\\n  -p \"$PUBLIC_PORT:8000/tcp\" \\\n  -v \"$CONFIG_PATH:/home/node/app/config:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$DATA_PATH:/home/node/app/data:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$EXTENSIONS_PATH:/home/node/app/public/scripts/extensions/third-party:rw\" \\\n  -v \"$PLUGINS_PATH:/home/node/app/plugins:rw\" \\\n  ghcr.io/sillytavern/sillytavern:\"$SILLYTAVERN_VERSION\"\n```\n\n## Container Healthcheck\n\n**Staging Feature**\n\nThis is currently only available on the `staging` branch of SillyTavern, and not part of the latest release.\n\n**The Docker image includes a built-in healthcheck mechanism that monitors the SillyTavern server's responsiveness. This is useful for container orchestration systems (like Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm) to detect and automatically restart unresponsive containers.**\n\n### How it works\n\nThe healthcheck uses a heartbeat file mechanism:\n\n1. When enabled, the SillyTavern server periodically writes a timestamp to a `heartbeat.json` file in the data directory.\n2. The healthcheck script (`src/healthcheck.js`) verifies that the heartbeat file exists and was recently updated.\n3. If the heartbeat file is missing or too old (more than 2 missed intervals), the container is marked as unhealthy.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe healthcheck script doesn't support overriding the data directory via command line arguments. If you change the data directory from the default `/home/node/app/data`, ensure that the `SILLYTAVERN_DATAROOT` environment variable is set accordingly.\n\n**The healthcheck is controlled by the `SILLYTAVERN_HEARTBEATINTERVAL` environment variable (or `heartbeatInterval` in config.yaml). This value specifies the interval in seconds between heartbeat writes.**\n\n- **Default:** `0` (disabled)\n- **Recommended:** `30` seconds when using Docker healthchecks\n\nThe default `docker-compose.yml` file includes healthcheck configuration with the heartbeat enabled:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  sillytavern:\n    environment:\n      - SILLYTAVERN_HEARTBEATINTERVAL=30\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [\"CMD\", \"node\", \"src/healthcheck.js\"]\n      interval: 30s\n      timeout: 10s\n      start_period: 20s\n      retries: 3\n```\n\n### Checking container health status\n\nYou can check the health status of your container using:\n\n```sh\ndocker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' sillytavern\n```\n\nOr view the full container status including health:\n\n```sh\ndocker ps\n```\n\nThe `STATUS` column will show `healthy`, `unhealthy`, or `starting` alongside the uptime.\n\n### Disabling the healthcheck\n\nIf you don't need the healthcheck feature, you can disable it by:\n\n1. Setting the environment variable to `0`:\n\n    ```yaml\n    environment:\n      - SILLYTAVERN_HEARTBEATINTERVAL=0\n    ```\n\n2. Removing or commenting out the `healthcheck` section in your `docker-compose.yml`.\n\n## Common issues with Docker\n\n### SELinux Permission Issues with Mounted Volumes\n\nLinux distributions with SELinux enabled (such as RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) may prevent Docker containers from accessing mounted volumes due to security policies. This can result in permission denied errors when the container tries to read or write to the mounted directories.\n\nTwo suffixes `:z` or `:Z` can be added to the volume mount. These suffixes tell Docker to relabel file objects on the shared volumes.\n\n- The `z` option is used when the volume content will be shared between containers.\n- The `Z` option is used when the volume content should only be used by the current container.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\n# docker-compose.yml\nvolumes:\n  ## Shared volume\n  - ./config:/home/node/app/config:z\n  ## Private volume\n  - ./data:/home/node/app/data:Z\n```\n\n### Forbidden by Whitelist\n\n**Docker gateway IPs should be whitelisted automatically if [whitelistDockerHosts](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md) config value is set to `true`.**\n\nIf you are still unable to access SillyTavern, follow the instructions below to update the whitelist manually.\n\n**1. Execute the following Docker command to obtain the IP of your SillyTavern Docker container.**\n\n    ```sh\n    docker network inspect docker_default\n    ```\n\n    You should receive some sort of output similar to the following below.\n\n    ```json\n    [\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"docker_default\",\n            \"IPAM\": {\n                \"Config\": [\n                    {\n                        \"Subnet\": \"172.18.0.0/16\",\n                        \"Gateway\": \"172.18.0.1\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n    Copy down the IP you see in _Gateway_ as this will be important.\n\n2. Running a text editor of your choice with administrator rights, go to `config` and open `config.yaml`.\n\n    Within your editor, go down to the `whitelist` section. You should see something similar to the following below.\n\n    ```yaml\n    whitelist:\n        - 127.0.0.1\n    ```\n\n    Add a new line below _127.0.0.1_ and put in the IP you copied from Docker. It should look something similar to the following afterwards.\n\n    ```yaml\n    whitelist:\n        - 127.0.0.1\n        - 172.18.0.1\n    ```\n\n    Save the file and exit the text editor.\n\n    Note that if you configured Docker network as a bridge, you could also add external IP addresses to the whitelist as usual.\n\n**3. Restart the Docker Container to apply the new configuration.**\n\n    ```sh\n    docker compose restart sillytavern\n    ```"

It's suitable for the majority of users. Typically updated once a month.\n* `staging` - \u26a0\ufe0f **Not recommended for casual use.** This branch has the latest features, but be cautious as it may break at any time. Only for power users and enthusiasts. Updates several times daily.\n\n## Global / Standalone mode\n\nThere are two modes of running SillyTavern that differ in how they handle the configuration and data paths.\n\n* **Standalone mode** (default) - uses the `config.yaml` file and `data` directory in the server directory. All data will be constrained to the installation path. This is the recommended mode for most users.\n* **Global mode** - uses the system-wide paths for configuration and data. This is useful for installing SillyTavern as a package or when you want to share the same configuration and data across multiple installations.\n\nInstallations made by using the official npm package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sillytavern) (e.g. `npx sillytavern@latest`) will run in global mode by default.\n\n**### Data paths**\n\n**Standalone mode** paths are relative to the SillyTavern installation directory:\n\n* **Config path**: `./config.yaml`\n* **Data root**: `./data/`\n\n**Global mode** paths are OS-dependent:\n\n* **Linux**: `~/.local/share/SillyTavern/config.yaml` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/SillyTavern/config.yaml`) and `~/.local/share/SillyTavern/data/` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/SillyTavern/data/`)\n* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\SillyTavern\\config.yaml` and `%APPDATA%\\SillyTavern\\data\\`\n* **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/SillyTavern/config.yaml` and `~/Library/Application Support/SillyTavern/data/`\n\n### How to run in global mode\n\n`dataRoot` and `configPath` can't be overridden with [CLI arguments](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md) or [config.yaml](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md) when running in global mode.\n\n**1. Pass the `--global` argument to the server startup command (e.g. `node server.js --global`).**\n\n2. Pass the `--global` argument to the shell startup script (e.g. `Start.bat --global` or `./start.sh --global`).\n3. Use the `start:global` script in the `package.json` file (e.g. `npm run start:global`)."

    "content": "# How to Update SillyTavern\n\nFind your OS below and follow the instructions to update ST.\n\n**For installation instructions, see the [Installation](SillyTavern_Installation_index.md) page.**\n\nThis guide assumes you have already installed and run SillyTavern at least once.\n\n**----**\n\n## Linux/Termux or MacOS\n\nYou definitely installed via git, so just 'git pull' inside the SillyTavern directory.\n\n- `cd SillyTavern` to enter the correct folder.\n- `git pull` to get the update.\n- `./start.sh` or `bash start.sh` to start ST.\n\n----\n\n## Windows\n\n>First try using the `UpdateAndStart.bat` which is located in your SillyTavern installation base folder.\n\nIf that fails, come back here and continue reading.\n\n### Method 1 - GIT\n\nWe always recommend users install using 'git'. Here's why:\n\nWhen you have installed via `git clone`, all you have to do to update is type `git pull` in a command line in the ST folder (https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+open+command+prompt+in+a+folder).\nAlternatively, if the command prompt gives you problems (and you have GitHub Desktop installed), you can use the `Repository` menu and select `Pull`.\n\nThe updates are applied automatically and safely.\n\n#### \"Help I originally installed via Zip and now want to convert to Git install\"\n\nYou have chosen a wise path.\n\nSince your installation was done via Zip, you will need to make a new install using git.\n\nThankfully we have [instructions](SillyTavern_Installation_Windows.md) on how to do so.\n\nOnce you have used git to install a NEW SillyTavern into a DIFFERENT folder, come back to this page and proceed to **Step 4** of the 'Zip Update' instructions below.\n\n### Method 2 - ZIP\n\nIf you insist on installing via a zip, here is the tedious process for doing the update:\n\n1. Download the new release zip.\n2. Unzip it into a folder OUTSIDE of your current ST installation.\n3. Do the usual setup procedure for your OS to install NodeJS requirements.\n\n4. Copy the following files/folders as necessary(*) from your old ST installation:\n\n    (*) 'As necessary' = \"If you made any custom content related to those folders\".\n    \n    #### Updating >=1.12.0\n    \n    Copy the `/data` directory and `config.yaml` file from one installation to another. If you have server-wide extensions (installed for \"All users\") that you want to preserve, also copy the `/public/scripts/extensions/third-party` directory.\n    \n    #### Updating from <1.12.0 to >1.12.0\n    \n    1.12.0 includes an automated migration procedure. The steps below are required *only* if the migration was interrupted or errored.\n\n5. Run the updated server install at least once to create the `/data/default-user` directory.\n6. Transfer the files from old `/public` to new `/data/default-user` as necessary.\n    \n    None of the folders are mandatory, so only copy what you need.\n    \n    **NOTE: DO NOT COPY THE ENTIRE /PUBLIC/ FOLDER**\n    \n    Doing so could break the new install and prevent new features from being present.\n    \n    ```plaintext\n    Assets\n    Backgrounds\n    Characters\n    Chats\n    Context\n    Groups\n    Group chats\n    Instruct\n    movingUI\n    KoboldAI Settings\n    NovelAI Settings\n    OpenAI Settings\n    QuickReplies\n    TextGen Settings (textgen = ooba)\n    Themes\n    User Avatars\n    Worlds\n    User\n    settings.json\n    secrets.json <---- this one is in the base folder, not /public/\n    ```\n\n7. Once those folders/files are copied, paste them into the /data/default-user folder (with secrets.json going into the folder root) of the new install.\n8. Start SillyTavern once again with the method appropriate to your OS, and pray you got it right.\n9. If everything shows up, you can safely delete the old ST folder.\n\n### Common Update Problems\n\n#### \"There are unresolved conflicts in the working directory.\"\n\nThis means that you've modified default files that have been changed in the remote repository (such as setting presets).\n\nTo fix this, run this in the terminal. Use cautiously, as it can be destructive. Make sure to have a backup if needed.\n\n```bash\ngit merge --abort\ngit reset --hard\ngit pull --rebase --autostash\n```\n\n#### File changes prevent git pull\n\n- If you change SillyTavern system files, `git pull` may not work.\n- Sometimes an update may require us to change an important file, which can cause the same problem.\n- Usually it is default preset files or `package-lock.json`.\n- In this case you can try moving the file to a different folder (or deleting the file) and then do `git pull`.\n- Another solution is using `git pull --rebase --autostash`\n\n#### Error: Cannot find module \"***\" when starting the server\n\n- This means that SillyTavern added a new npm package requirement.\n- Run `npm install` in the SillyTavern directory to fix this. Provided Start.bat and start.sh scripts will do that automatically.\n- Didn't help? Remove the node_modules folder\n\n**Windows**\n\n```bash\nrmdir /s /q node_modules\nnpm cache clean --force\nnpm install\n```\n\n**Unix/Linux**\n\n```bash\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm cache clean --force\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Docker\n\n1. Open a terminal window and navigate to your docker directory `cd SillyTavern/docker`\n2. Delete your container with `docker compose down`\n3. Delete the SillyTavern docker image from cache `docker rmi ghcr.io/sillytavern/sillytavern:latest` (Replace `sillytavern:latest` with `sillytavern:staging` if you are targeting the staging branch.)\n4. Rebuild the container with `sudo docker compose up -d`\n\nIf everything goes smoothly, docker should start redownloading the image, and you will be up and running shortly. If you face any issues, refer to the next section of this guide.\n\n### Common Update Problems\n#### I use Docker and all my data is gone after the update!\n\nYou must follow the [Migration guide for Docker containers](SillyTavern_Installation_Updating_ST-1.12.0-Migration-Guide.md)\n to update volume mappings for the new data model introduced in 1.12.0\n\n#### Permission denied when running docker commands\n\nThis is a Linux issue, and implies that your permissions are not properly set up. There are two ways to get around this:\n\n1. **The Easy method**: If you have sudo access on your user, simply prefix commands with `sudo` (for example: `sudo docker compose down`) \n2. **The Proper method**: Fix your permissions. This varies depending on the version of Linux you use. There are plenty of guides online to help you fix this issue."

    "content": "# How to update Node.js\n\nIt's important to keep your Node.js runtime up to date for security and performance reasons. Below are the steps to update Node.js depending on your operating system.\n\nWe recommend using the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version, which you can find on the Node.js official website (https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).\n\n## How to check your current Node.js version\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Type the following command and press Enter:\n\n```bash\nnode -v\n```\n\n## nvm (Node Version Manager) - Cross-Platform\n\nIf you are using `nvm`:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Type in the following command:\n\n**Unix/Linux/macOS:** (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)\n\n```bash\nnvm install --lts\nnvm use --lts\n```\n\n**Windows:** (https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)\n\n```bash\nnvm install lts\nnvm use lts\n```\n\n## Windows - Regular Installation\n\n1. Go to the Node.js download page (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n2. Download the Windows Installer for the LTS version.\n3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.\n\n## Windows - SillyTavern Launcher\n\nIf you have installed using the SillyTavern Launcher:\n\n1. Open the SillyTavern Launcher.\n2. Navigate to `Toolbox / App Installer / Core Utilities / Install Node.js`.\n\n**OR:**\n\nDo it manually using winget in PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\nwinget install --id=OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS  -e\n```\n\n## Android - Termux\n\n1. Open the Termux app.\n2. Type the following commands:\n\n```bash\npkg update\npkg upgrade nodejs-lts\n```\n\nDon't forget to accept any prompts that may appear during the update process by pressing `Y` on the virtual keyboard.\n\n## macOS - Regular Installation\n\n1. Go to the Node.js download page (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n2. Download the macOS Installer for the LTS version.\n3. Run the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts to complete the installation.\n\n## macOS - Homebrew\n\nIf you have Homebrew installed, you can update Node.js with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nbrew update\nbrew upgrade node\n```\n\n## Linux - Package Manager\n\nThe method to update Node.js on Linux depends on your distribution.\n\nBut as the version of Node.js in the official repositories may not be the latest, we recommend using the Node Version Manager (nvm) (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or the NodeSource repository (https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).\n\n## Docker\n\nNo action required. The prebuilt Docker image we provide is compiled with the up-to-date version of Node.js."

    "content": "# 1.12.0 Migration Guide\n\nSillyTavern 1.12.0 (codename the \"Neo Server\" update) includes several critical changes that may affect the way you use SillyTavern.\n\nThis guide will prepare you for the update and provide some further guidance.\n\n## Data storage update\n\n1.12.0 changes the way SillyTavern handles the user data.\n\nPreviously, all of the persistent data was stored together with the frontend part in the `/public` directory, which created confusion and potential points of failure, as well as making containerization and system-wide app installation quite challenging.\n\n### What's changed?\n\nAll persistent information from `/public` such as settings and chats (full list below) was moved into a separate directory with the configurable path, making it portable and independent from the web server itself. When needed for compatibility purposes, for example, for hosting extensions, full-size character cards, user image uploads, etc. a smart redirect has been set up to automatically host user files from the data directory.\n\n### Setting a data root\n\nYou can provide either an absolute or a relative (to the ST repository directory) path to the data root either by `config.yaml` or by starting the server with the `--dataRoot` console argument.\n\n> YAML example\n\n```yaml\n# -- DATA CONFIGURATION --\n# Root directory for user data storage\ndataRoot: C:\\Users\\Harry\\Documents\\ST-Data\n```\n\n> Console example\n\n```bash\nnode server.js --dataRoot=\"/Users/harry/ST-Data\"\n# OR\nnpm run start -- --dataRoot=\"/Users/harry/ST-Data\"\n```\n\nThe default data root path is `./data`, which means the `data` directory in SillyTavern's repository.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe data root path should be either a **full absolute** or a **full relative** path. You _can't_ use path shortcuts like `~` or `%APP_DATA%`, as these are resolved by a shell, not the operating system.\n\n**### Migration**\n\n#### **IMPORTANT!** Before we begin\n\n1. **Only if you want to move dataRoot from the default location. Otherwise, skip this part.** Set the data root _before_ first running the server after pulling an update. Run `npm install` for the `config.yaml` to populate with a new value, or pass a console argument.\n2. All data will be migrated into a `default-user` account. See more on [Users](SillyTavern_Installation_Updating.md) below.\n\n#### Containerless (bare metal) installs\n\nYou don't have to do anything! An automatic migration should handle everything for you when you start the ST server and it detects the old storage format (by checking the existence of the `/public/characters` directory).\n\nUpon moving any files, an automatic backup will be created in the `/backups/_migration/YYYY-MM-DD` (resolved to the current date) directory, but it is always a good practice to make a full manual backup before running the migration.\n\n#### Containerized (Docker) installs\n\nMigrating the data in Docker volumes is a bit trickier but pretty straightforward. While `docker-compose.yml` provided with the repo was updated to reflect the changes, you may need to adjust your custom workflows/deployments.\n\n**Step 1.** Create a new volume, and mount it to the \"/home/node/app/data\" path within the container. Don't remove the `config` volume.\n\n```yaml\nvolumes:\n    - \"./config:/home/node/app/config\"\n    - \"./data:/home/node/app/data\"\n```\n\n**Step 2.** Move everything but the `config.yaml` file from the `config` volume into the `default-user` subdirectory of the `data` volume.\n\n**Step 3.** Rebuild the container and start it up.\n\n**Note**\n\nSoft links between the `/public` directory and the `config` volume are no longer needed and are not built into the Docker container!\n\n**#### What to migrate?**\n\nThe following files and directories are subject to the data migration. Assuming the default configuration, the before and after paths are provided in the table below.\n\n| Before                                 | After                                |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| /secrets.json                          | /data/default-user/secrets.json      |\n| /thumbnails                            | /data/default-user/thumbnails        |\n| /vectors                               | /data/default-user/vectors           |\n| /public/settings.json                  | /data/default-user/settings.json     |\n| /public/stats.json                     | /data/default-user/stats.json        |\n| /public/assets                         | /data/default-user/assets            |\n| /public/backgrounds                    | /data/default-user/backgrounds       |\n| /public/characters                     | /data/default-user/characters        |\n| /public/chats                          | /data/default-user/chats             |\n| /public/context                        | /data/default-user/context           |\n| /public/scripts/extensions/third-party | /data/default-user/extensions        |\n| /public/group chats                    | /data/default-user/group chats       |\n| /public/groups                         | /data/default-user/groups            |\n| /public/instruct                       | /data/default-user/instruct          |\n| /public/KoboldAI Settings              | /data/default-user/KoboldAI Settings |\n| /public/movingUI                       | /data/default-user/movingUI          |\n| /public/NovelAI Settings               | /data/default-user/NovelAI Settings  |\n| /public/OpenAI Settings                | /data/default-user/OpenAI Settings   |\n| /public/QuickReplies                   | /data/default-user/QuickReplies      |\n| /public/TextGen Settings               | /data/default-user/TextGen Settings  |\n| /public/themes                         | /data/default-user/themes            |\n| /public/worlds                         | /data/default-user/worlds            |\n| /default/content/content.log           | /data/default-user/content.log       |\n\n## Users\n\n1.12.0 adds a (completely optional) ability to create a multi-user setup on the same server, allowing multiple users to use their own fully isolated SillyTavern instances even at the same time. User accounts can also be password-protected for an additional layer of privacy.\n\nPlease refer to the [Users](SillyTavern_Administration_multi-user.md) documentation for more information."

If you wish to *disable* it, open the Extensions panel, click on \"Manager extensions\", locate Connection Profiles in the list, uncheck the \"Enabled\" checkbox, and then click \"Close\".\n\n## What is Saved\n\nConnection Profiles store the following selections.\n\n### Common\n\n* [API type, model and the server URL](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_index.md)\n* [Secret Key](SillyTavern_Usage_faq.md)\n* [Settings preset](SillyTavern_Usage_Common-Settings.md)\n* [Start Reply With](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) (can be explicitly empty)\n* [Custom Stopping Strings](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) (can be explicitly empty)\n* [Reasoning Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_reasoning.md)\n\n### Text Completion APIs\n\n* [System Prompt and its state](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md)\n* [Instruct Mode state and template](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_instructmode.md)\n* [Context Template](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md)\n* [Tokenizer](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md)\n\n### Chat Completion APIs\n\n* [Prompt Post-Processing](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_openai.md)\n* Proxy preset\n\n## Managing Connection Profiles\n\n**Note**\n\nProfiles only save the selection in dropdown fields, without knowing anything about the underlying settings. This means that you will lose unsaved changes by switching to a different profile. To prevent this, make sure to update all presets and templates if you don't want to lose ephemeral changes.\n\n*** To save a profile, set all the required settings and click the \"Create\" button. Then review the settings and provide a name for the profile. **A name should be unique.****\n\n* To view the detailed information about a chosen profile, click on the \"Information\" button. Click again to hide the details.\n* Connection Profile settings are saved into `settings.json` without altering the associated profile save file until you press the \"Update\" button. This means that if you setup a profile, but then switch to a different one without updating, you will lose all of your previous changes.\n* To restore the changed selections from a saved profile, click the \"Reload\" button.\n* To delete a profile, click the \"Delete\" button and confirm the deletion. **This action is irreversible.**\n\n## Slash Commands\n\nConnection profiles can be managed using the following slash commands.\n\n1. `/profile [name]` - switch to a profile if the argument is provided, or get the name of the current profile if not.\n2. `/profile-create [name]` - saves the current settings as a new profile with the provided name.\n3. `/profile-list` - returns a JSON-serialized array of available profile names.\n4. `/profile-get [name]` - gets the details of the profile with the provided name as a JSON-serialized object.\n5. `/profile-update` - updates the selected profile with the current settings."

    "content": "# Google Gemini\n\nGemini is Google's cutting-edge multimodal LLM, which is available though several APIs, including Google Vertex AI and Google AI Studio (formerly MakerSuite). This guide will help you set up the Gemini API connections in SillyTavern.\n\n## Google AI Studio\n\nAI Studio is the fastest and the most user-friendly way to try out the latest Google AI models without needing to set up a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. It provides a simple API key that you can use to access the Gemini models.\n\n### Step 1: Create a Google AI Studio Key\n\n1. Go to the Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) page and sign in with your Google account.\n2. Click on \"Get API Key\", accept the terms and conditions.\n3. Click \"Create API Key\" to generate your API key.\n4. Copy the API key to your clipboard.\n\n### Step 2: Put the API Key into SillyTavern\n\n1. In SillyTavern, go to the \"API Connections\" page.\n2. Select \"Chat Completion\" as the API type.\n3. Select \"Google AI Studio\" from the dropdown menu.\n4. Enter the API key you copied earlier into the \"API Key\" text box.\n5. Click the \"Connect\" button to save the key.\n\nYou should now be able to use the Google AI Studio API with SillyTavern.\n\n## Google Vertex AI\n\nVertex AI is a service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides access to various AI models, including the Gemini series.\n\nThere are several ways a Vertex AI API can be set up, and the available models may vary depending on the method used.\n\n### Service Account\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) requires a service account to access Vertex AI, simple API keys will not work. A token will be generated from the service account JSON file, which will then be used to authenticate requests to the Vertex AI API.\n\nYou can create a service account by following these steps:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n1. You must have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.\n2. You must have a project created within your GCP account.\n3. You must have billing enabled for that project.\n\n#### Step 1: Enable the Vertex AI API\n\nBefore your key can work, the API must be enabled for your project.\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: <https://console.cloud.google.com/>\n2. Make sure the correct project is selected in the top bar.\n3. Navigate to the Vertex AI API page: <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com>\n4. If it's not already enabled, click the \"Enable\" button.\n\n#### Step 2: Create the Service Account\n\nThis is the identity that will be used to access the Vertex AI API.\n\n1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the \"Service Accounts\" page. You can search for it in the top search bar or use this direct link: <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts>\n2. Select your GCP project and click \"+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT\".\n3. Service account name: Give it a descriptive name, like `my-vertex-ai-client`.\n4. Click \"CREATE AND CONTINUE\".\n5. Grant this service account access to project: In the \"Role\" dropdown, search for and select Vertex AI User. This role grants the necessary permissions to run models without giving away too much access.\n6. Click \"CONTINUE\", and then click \"DONE\".\n\n#### Step 3: Generate the JSON Key\n\nThis is the \"password\" file you need. It contains sensitive information, so don't share it or upload it anywhere public.\n\n1. You should now be back on the Service Accounts list. Find the account you just created (e.g., sillytavern-vertex-ai).\n2. Click the three-dot menu (\u22ee) on the far right of that row and select \"Manage keys\".\n3. Click \"ADD KEY\" -> \"Create new key\".\n4. Ensure the Key type is set to JSON.\n5. Click \"CREATE\".\n\nA .json file will immediately be downloaded to your computer. Keep it safe, because this key can't be recovered if lost.\n\n#### Step 4: Put the JSON Content into SillyTavern\n\nThe JSON file you downloaded contains all the information needed to authenticate with the Vertex AI API. It will look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"service_account\",\n    \"project_id\": \"your-gcp-project-name\",\n    \"private_key_id\": \"...\",\n    \"private_key\": \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\n...\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\",\n    \"client_email\": \"sillytavern-vertex-ai@your-gcp-project-name.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\n    \"client_id\": \"...\",\n    \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n    \"token_uri\": \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\",\n    \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n    \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n1. Open the .json file you just downloaded with a simple text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or VS Code).\n2. Select all the text in the file (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A).\n3. Copy the text to your clipboard (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).\n4. In SillyTavern, go to the \"API Connections\" page, select \"Chat Completion\" as the API type, and then select \"Google Vertex AI\" from the dropdown menu. Switch the authentication method to \"Service Account\".\n5. Paste the entire copied content into the \"Service Account JSON Content\" text box.\n6. Click the \"Validate JSON\" button to make sure you copied it correctly.\n7. Finally, scroll down and click \"Connect\" at the bottom of the API settings page.\n\nYou should now be able to use the Google Vertex AI API with SillyTavern.\n\n### Express Mode\n\nExpress mode is the quickest way to get started with using Generative AI on Google Cloud. It allows you to use the Gemini API without needing to set up a service account. Instead, you can use an API key directly.\n\nSee the official documentation for more details: Vertex AI in express mode overview (https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview).\n\n#### Step 1: Ensure your account is eligible for Express Mode\n\nYou must have a Google account that was not previously used to create a Google Cloud project.\nIf you have an existing Google Cloud project (including free trials), you can create a new one for this purpose.\n\n#### Step 2: Active the Vertex AI Express Mode\n\n1. Go to the following web page: Vertex AI Studio (https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio).\n2. Click on \"Try it free\".\n3. Accept the terms and conditions and sign in with your Google account.\n4. Choose your country and click \"Agree & start free\". Wait for the setup to complete.\n\n#### Step 3: Create an API Key\n\n1. Verify that your Google Cloud console is running in Express Mode. You should see a banner at the top left corner of the page.\n2. Click on the \"API Keys\" link in the left sidebar.\n3. Click on the \"Create API Key\" button.\n4. A new API key will be generated. Copy this key to your clipboard.\n\n#### Step 4: Put the API Key into SillyTavern\n\n1. In SillyTavern, go to the \"API Connections\" page.\n2. Select \"Chat Completion\" as the API type.\n3. Select \"Google Vertex AI\" from the dropdown menu.\n4. Switch the authentication method to \"Express Mode (API Key)\".\n5. Paste the API key you copied earlier into the \"API Key\" text box.\n6. Click the \"Connect\" button to save the key.\n\nYou should now be able to use the Google Vertex AI API in Express Mode with SillyTavern."

    "content": "# AI Horde\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- AI Horde is a crowdsourced, distributed GPU cluster run entirely by volunteers.\n- By default, your inputs are anonymously sent and responses can not be seen by the person running the Horde Worker.\n- However, since it is an open-sourced program, Malicious Workers could modify the code to:\n  - log your activity (input prompts, AI responses).\n  - produce bad or offensive responses.\n\nWhen using Horde **never send** any personal information such as names, email addresses, etc.\n\n**Switching on the \"Trusted Workers Only\" checkbox will limit the selection of available workers to only those who have been hosting on Horde for a while and are generally considered trusted. But they could still be seeing prompts, for example by hosting using unaccounted software.**\n\nTo help reduce this problem, SillyTavern has built in the following feature:\n\n- When a chat response is generated by a Horde Worker, SillyTavern records the Worker's ID and what model they were using.\n- This information can be seen by hovering your mouse cursor over the chat item (see image below).\n- If you believe you received a malicious response, you can pass this information to the Horde admin on the AI Horde Discord (https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn) for review and possible disciplinary action against that Worker.\n\n## Setup\n\n- SillyTavern is able to connect with Horde out of the box with no additional setup required.\n- Select 'AI Horde' from the API Dropdown Selector in the ST API Panel.\n- Select one or more Models ('AI brains' for the characters) from the Model Selector at the bottom of the panel.\n- Select a character and begin chatting.\n\nBy default, your SillyTavern instance connects to the Horde's low priority 'guest account'.\nThis means you may have to wait a long time for a reply.\nTo reduce wait times, follow the tips down below.\n\n**## Tips**\n\n- Register an account on the Horde website (https://aihorde.net/register) then add your Horde key into the SillyTavern Horde API Key box.\n- Set up a Horde Worker (https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-Worker#readme) to provide your GPU for others.\n  - Letting others use your GPU earns you 'Kudos', a kind of Horde-only currency (https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde/blob/main/FAQ.md#kudos).\n  - The more kudos your account has, the faster you will get chat responses from other Horde Workers.\n  - Kudos can also be used to create AI images on Stable Horde (https://stablehorde.net).\n    - SillyTavern supports Stable Horde image generation out of the box.\n- If your GPU isn't powerful enough to run an AI, or you don't have a computer, you can still participate in the Horde community to earn Kudos in various ways (https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde/blob/main/FAQ.md#i-dont-have-a-powerful-gpu-how-can-i-get-kudos)."

    "content": "# API Connections\n\nSillyTavern can connect to a wide range of LLM APIs.\nBelow is a description of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and use cases.\n\n## ELI5: Chat Completions vs Text Completions\n\nWhen you first navigate to the \"API Connections\" page in ST, you will notice a drop-down option to select between options using nomenclature such as \"Chat Completion\" and \"Text Completion\". It's helpful to understand what this means.\n\nWhat it's not: It's easy to think of \"Text Completion\" as local models and \"Chat Completion\" as cloud-based LLMs, but that's not the case. Neither is e.g. \"Novel AI\" or \"Kobold\" actually a separate type of model altogether, even though they are separate options in the API dropdown in ST. You can force models into different API structures with the appropriate backend, but that's not the point of this section.\n\nWhen you send a message using ST, your chat, character description, and other prompts such as lorebooks or author's notes are constructed into a single \"prompt\" to be sent to the model. The API \"type\" for the model you are using decides how exactly this prompt will be constructed (something that ST takes care of for you automatically in the background - you can open your ST terminal and see exactly what the prompt being sent to the AI looks like).\n\n### Chat Completions\n\nA Chat Completion model, as its name suggests, will structure your prompt into a series of messages between the User (you) and the Assistant (the AI) or System (neutral). Models that are trained for Chat Completion help create the feeling of a \"Chat\", with the AI \"responding\" to the last message. When you're using the ChatGPT website, you're dealing with a Chat Completions API in the background.\n\n### Text Completions (a.k.a just \"Completions\")\n\nA Text Completion on the other hand, and again as its name suggests, will convert your prompt into one long string, and the model will simply try to continue this (like, literally imagine all your text, your hundreds of messages, all your formatting, newlines, etc. squashed into one very long sentence).\n\nIf your messages in ST happen to be formatted as a series of messages between YourPersona: and Character:, the Text Completion model will try to continue this pattern and ST will render it as a new chat message for you, but really the model is just trying to continue the text. If you offered an input of \"The Sun rises in the\", a text completion model is likely to finish that message for you with \"East\".\n\nMost Text Completion models have a recommended \"Instruct Template\" (usually mentioned in the model's documentation or download page) that helps them \"respond\" to messages and instructions, just like a Chat Completion model. ST usually has most (if not all) Instruct Templates available for you to choose from in the \"Advanced Formatting\" page.\n\n## Local APIs\n\n- These LLM APIs can be run on your PC.\n- They are free to use and have no content filter.\n- Installation process can be complex (**The SillyTavern dev team does not provide support for this**).\n- Requires separate download of LLM models from HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/models?other=LLM) which can be 5-50GB each.\n- Most models are not as powerful as cloud LLM APIs.\n\n### KoboldCpp\n\n- Easy-to-use API with CPU offloading (helpful for low VRAM users) and streaming\n- Runs from a single binary file on Windows, Mac, and Linux\n- Supports GGUF models\n- Slower than GPU-only loaders such as AutoGPTQ and Exllama/v2\n- GitHub (https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), [Setup Instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_koboldcpp.md)\n\n### llama.cpp\n\n- The original source from which KoboldCpp and Ollama were forked\n- Provides pre-compiled binaries and an option to compile from source\n- Supports GGUF models\n- Lightweight CLI interface for llama-server\n- GitHub (https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)\n\n### Ollama\n\n- Easiest to set up and use of all llama.cpp-based APIs\n- A nifty catalog (https://ollama.com/library) of models available for one-click download\n- Supports GGUF models wrapped in Ollama's own format\n- GitHub (https://github.com/ollama/ollama), Website (https://ollama.com/)\n\n### Oobabooga TextGeneration WebUI\n\n- All-in-one Gradio UI with streaming\n- Broadest support for quantized (AWQ, Exl2, GGML, GGUF, GPTQ) and FP16 models\n- One-click installers available\n- Regular updates, which can sometimes break compatibility with SillyTavern\n- GitHub (https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui#one-click-installers)\n\n**Correct Way to Connect SillyTavern to Ooba's new OpenAI API:**\n\n1. Make sure you're on the latest update of Oobabooga's TextGen (as of Nov 14th, 2023).\n2. Edit the CMD_FLAGS.txt file, and add the `--api` flag there. Then restart Ooba's server.\n3. Connect ST to `http://localhost:5000/` (by default) without checking the 'Legacy API' box. You may remove the `/v1` postfix from the URL Ooba's console provides you.\n\n*You can change the API hosting port with the `--api-port 5001` flag, where 5001 is your custom port.*\n\n### TabbyAPI\n\n- Lightweight Exllamav2 (https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2)-based API with streaming\n- Supports Exl2, GPTQ, and FP16 models\n- Official extension (https://github.com/theroyallab/ST-tabbyAPI-loader) allows loading/unloading models directly from SillyTavern\n- Not recommended for users with low VRAM (no CPU offloading)\n- GitHub (https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI), [Setup Instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_tabbyapi.md)\n\n### KoboldAI Classic (deprecated, abandoned)\n\n- Runs on your PC, 100% private, wide range of models available\n- Gives the most direct control of the AI's generation settings\n- Requires large amounts of VRAM in your GPU (6-24GB, depending on the LLM model)\n- Models limited to 2k context\n- No streaming\n- Popular KoboldAI versions:\n  - Henky's United (https://github.com/henk717/KoboldAI)\n  - 0cc4m's 4bit-supporting United (https://github.com/0cc4m/KoboldAI)\n\n## Cloud LLM APIs\n\n- These LLM APIs are run as cloud services and require no resources on your PC\n- They are stronger/smarter than most local LLMs\n- However, they all have content filtering of varying degrees, and most require payment\n\n### AI Horde\n\n- SillyTavern can access this API out of the box with no additional settings required\n- Uses the GPU of individual volunteers (Horde Workers) to process responses for your chat inputs\n- At the mercy of the Worker in terms of generation wait times, AI settings, and available models\n- Website (https://aihorde.net/), [Setup Instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_horde.md)\n\n### OpenAI (ChatGPT)\n\n- Easy to set up and acquire an API key\n- Requires prepayment for credits and charges per prompt\n- Very logical.

Leave it there for now.\n* Under the `Hardware` tab, tick `High Priority`.\n* Click `Save` so you don't have to configure KoboldCpp on every launch.\n* Click `Launch` and wait for the model to load.\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\n```txt\nLoad Model OK: True\nEmbedded Kobold Lite loaded.\nStarting Kobold API on port 5001 at http://localhost:5001/api/\nStarting OpenAI Compatible API on port 5001 at http://localhost:5001/v1/\n======\nPlease connect to custom endpoint at http://localhost:5001\n```\n\nYou can now connect to KoboldCpp within SillyTavern with `http://localhost:5001` as the API URL and start chatting.\n\n**Congratulations! You're done!**\n\nKind of.\n\n### GPU Layers\n\nKoboldCpp is working, but you can improve performance by ensuring that as many layers as possible are offloaded to the GPU. You should see something like this in the terminal:\n\n```txt\nllm_load_tensors: offloading 9 repeating layers to GPU\nllm_load_tensors: offloaded 9/33 layers to GPU\nllm_load_tensors: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CPU buffer size = 25215.88 MiB\nllm_load_tensors: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CUDA0 buffer size = \u00a07043.34 MiB\n....................................................................................................\nllama_kv_cache_init: \u00a0CUDA_Host KV buffer size = \u00a01479.19 MiB\nllama_kv_cache_init: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CUDA0 KV buffer size = \u00a0 578.81 MiB\n```\n\nDon't be afraid of numbers; this part is easier than it looks. `CPU buffer size` refers to how much system RAM is being used. Ignore that. `CUDA0 buffer size` refers to how much GPU VRAM is being used. `CUDA_Host KV buffer size` and `CUDA0 KV buffer size` refer to how much GPU VRAM is being dedicated to your model's context. In this case, KoboldCpp is using about 9 GB of VRAM.\n\nI have 12 GB of VRAM, and only 2 GB of VRAM is being used for context, so I have about 10 GB of VRAM left over to load the model. Because 9 layers used about 7 GB of VRAM and `7000 / 9 = 777.77` we can assume each layer uses approximately `777.77 MIB` of VRAM. `10,000 MIB / 777.77 = 12.8`, so I'll round down and load 12 layers with this model from now on.\n\nNow do your own math using the model, context size, and VRAM for your system, and restart KoboldCpp:\n\n* If you're smart, you clicked `Save` before, and now you can load your previous configuration with `Load`. Otherwise, select the same settings you chose before.\n* Change the `GPU Layers` to your new, VRAM-optimized number (12 layers in my case).\n* Click `Save` to save your updated configuration.\n\nYou should now see something like this:\n\n```txt\nllm_load_tensors: offloading 12 repeating layers to GPU\nllm_load_tensors: offloaded 12/33 layers to GPU\nllm_load_tensors: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CPU buffer size = 25215.88 MiB\nllm_load_tensors: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CUDA0 buffer size = \u00a09391.12 MiB\n....................................................................................................\nllama_kv_cache_init: \u00a0CUDA_Host KV buffer size = \u00a01286.25 MiB\nllama_kv_cache_init: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CUDA0 KV buffer size = \u00a0 771.75 MiB\n```\n\nKoboldCpp is using about 11.5 GB of my 12 GB VRAM. This should perform a lot better than the settings generated automatically by KoboldCpp.\n\n**Congratulations! You're (actually) done!**\n\nFor a more in-depth look at KoboldCpp settings, check out Kalomaze's Simple Llama + SillyTavern Setup Guide (https://rentry.org/llama_v2_sillytavern)."

Register an account here to get started: <https://novelai.net/>\n\nYou will get only *50 generations* for free to evaluate the model. When the **\"Not eligible for this model\"** error appears, this means that you've exhausted your trial period and need to subscribe to a paid plan.\n\n## API Key\n\nTo get your NovelAI API key, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the gear icon at the top of the left sidebar.\n\n2. Select \"Account\" under \"User Settings\".\n\n3. Select \"Get Persistent API Token\".\n\n4. Select the copy icon to copy your NovelAI API token to the clipboard. \n\n## Models\n\nIf you have Opus, then Erato is the model to use. If you don't have Opus, then Kayra is the best available model.\n\nClio has a larger context size on Tablet/scroll tiers, but the strength of Kayra usually makes up for that difference.\n\n## Settings\n\nThe files with the settings are here (`SillyTavern/data/<user-handle>/NovelAI Settings`).\nYou can also manually add your own settings files.\n\n### Response Length\n\nHow much text you want to generate per message. Note that NovelAI has a limit of 150 tokens per response. \n\n### Context Size\n\nHow many tokens of the chat are kept in the context at any given time. How large the maximum context size you can use depends on the model and your subscription tier:\n\n- Kayra (Tablet) - 3072 tokens\n- Kayra (Scroll) - 6144 tokens\n- Erato (Opus exclusive), Kayra (Opus) and Clio (all tiers) - 8192 tokens\n\n### Preamble\n\nText that is inserted right above the chat to modify the writing style. The recommended format is a list of short tags, like \"[ Style: chat, detailed, sensory ]\". \n\n## Preset Descriptions\nThis is, according to Novel AI, what the default presets are good for.\n\n### Erato\n\n* Golden Arrow - A good all-rounder.\n* Wilder - Higher variety of word choice, more differences between rerolls, more prone to mistakes.\n* Zany Scribe - Avoids mistakes and repetition. Prioritizes more complex words.\n* Dragonfruit - Varied and complex language with little repetition. More frequent mistakes and contradictions.\n* Shosetsu - Designed for writing in Japanese. Works fine for English too.\n\n### Kayra\n\n* Asper - For creative writing. Expect unexpected twists.\n* Carefree - A good All-rounder\n* Fresh-Coffee - Keeps things on track. Handles instruct well.  \n* Pro_Writer - Mimic the pacing and feel of best-selling fiction\n* Stelenes - More likely to choose reasonable alternatives. Variety on retries.\n* Tea_Time - It gets good when it gets going.\n* Writers-Daemon - Extremely imaginative, sometimes too much.\n\n### Clio\n\n* Edgewise - Handles a variety of generation styles well\n* Fresh Coffee - Keeps things on track.\n* Long-Press - Intended for creative prose.\n* Talker Chat - Designed for chat style generation.\n* Vingt-Un - A good all-around default with a bent towards prose.\n\n## Tips and FAQs for using NovelAI with SillyTavern\n\nThere are a lot of common problems and questions that come up when switching to NovelAI from another ST backend API. The difference comes down to what the models are trained for. Most likely, you've used an OpenAI or Anthropic model (or a local model made to resemble those), which is built around following the user's instructions. NovelAI's models are built purely around text completion: instead of taking your input as a message and formulating a response, NAI's models attempt to continue the incoming prompt. Due to this difference, a lot of tips and common knowledge that work for other APIs won't work for NAI. \n\n### Tweaking settings for NovelAI\n\nUnder Advanced Formatting (the A icon):\n- Set \"Context Template\" to \"NovelAI\"\n- Set \"Tokenizer\" to \"Best match\"\n- Check \"Always add character's name to prompt\"\n- Check \"Collapse Consecutive Newlines\"\n- Uncheck the \"Enabled\" box under \"Instruct Mode\"\n\nUnder User Settings (the person with a gear)\n- Turn on \"Swipes\" (Not NAI specific, but it's so useful you should just do it)\n\n### Building/Adapting character cards for NovelAI\n\nTo optimize your character cards for NovelAI, there are a couple of recommended methods for writing your character's description: prose, and attributes. \n\nProse is so simple it doesn't feel like it should work: \"Sylpheed is a young-looking but actually 900 year old nymph. She's short and petite, with long white hair that fades into a green gradient in her braided side ponytail, and emerald green eyes shaped like crosses.[...]\" No, really, that's it. Just write out, in normal sentences, what the character looks like, acts like, etc., and the AI will pick up on it. \n\nIf you don't trust your writing abilities or want a more structured way to go about it, you can use the attributes method, which is present in the NovelAI training data. This works as a simple list of character traits of different types. Here's a list of possible attributes that have been tested to be effective with NovelAI's models:\n\n```\nName:\nAKA:\nType: character\nSetting:\nNationality:\nSpecies:\nGender:\nAge:\nHeight:\nWeight:\nAppearance:\nClothing:\nAttire:\nPersonality:\nMind:\nMental:\nLikes:\nDislikes:\nSexuality:\nSpeech:\nVoice:\nAbilities:\nSkills:\nQuote:\nAffiliation:\nOccupation:\nReputation:\nSecret:\nFamily:\nAllies:\nEnemies:\nBackground:\nDescription:\nAttributes:\n```\n\n\"Type: character\" is there to tell the AI that this is describing a character (as opposed to a location, object, or other type of thing). The rest of the attributes are optional, and some are redundant (for example, Personality, Mind, and Mental all mean basically the same thing), but these have been tested and work well with NovelAI's models. Fill in whichever ones are relevant to your character. The attributes should be written in lower case and separated by commas, no need for quotes around the words. For example:\n\n```\nSkills: lockpicking, stealth, running away very fast\n```\n\nThese methods are recommended because they're present in NovelAI's training data, so they specifically work well with the model. \n\n#### Example cards\n\nHere are a couple of example cards, made for NovelAI, that show off different ways of creating cards specifically for NovelAI. The first card, Valka, uses the attributes method for the character description, while Eris, the second card, uses prose descriptions, along with a large amount of example dialogue. \n\n<div style=\"display:flex;gap:2em;justify-content:center\">\n\n[](/static/Valka.png)\n\n[](/static/Eris.png)\n\n</div>\n\n#### What not to do\n\nMost of the existing character card formats are a poor fit for NovelAI. They'll give you some results, even some good ones, but they have a lot of problems. W++ is one of the biggest offenders, where it doesn't resemble anything that NovelAI's models were trained on, and its constant use of brackets/braces/quotes eats up a ton of tokens, bloating the size of the cards with no real benefit. \n\nOf the existing formats that aren't baked into NovelAI, AliChat is the one most likely to work, as it relies on using example messages to get across both information about the character and their voice at the same time, in the format of the type of message that you want the AI to output. \n\nFor most other formats, since they are usually ways of listing out different characteristics of a particular character, they can be converted to the attributes method rather straightforwardly. \n\n### Which module should I use?\n\nProbably No Module. Prose Augmenter is useful if you want a character to speak in a more flowery manner, but be careful not to overdo it. Text Adventure might be useful for a text adventure-style card/story. \n\n### Not the instruct module?\n\nYou can invoke the Instruct module when you need it. Create a newline in your message, and put your instructions in curly brackets like this: `{ CharName is offended by that seemingly innocuous statement }` (the spaces are _required_ between the text and the brackets). Doing that will automatically switch the AI into the Instruct module for a short time. You don't want to use the Instruct module all the time because it tends to produce less creative output than the other modules, just when you need to guide the AI strongly in a particular direction.\n\n### Why do my responses keep getting cut off?\n\nNovelAI limits response length to ~150 tokens total, even if you set the slider higher than that. When it reaches the number of tokens in the slider or 150, whichever is lower, it will generate up to 20 more tokens, looking for a stop sequence or the end of a sentence, so there's an effective limit of 170 tokens for a response, at which point it will just stop, causing it to cut off. \n\nIf it cuts off, you can select the continue option (in the three-line menu to the left of the text box) to get the character to continue their response. \n\nIf you regularly want responses longer than 170 tokens, you can work around the limit like this:\n\n- Keep the response length at 150 tokens.\n- Under Advanced Formatting, enable Auto-continue.\n- Set the \"Target length\" to the desired length.\n\nThis will chain together multiple generations to give you longer messages but doesn't guarantee that the reply will be 100% of the desired length if the model decides to stop.\n\n### How do I get the bot to write longer responses?\n\nRead the above about responses getting cut off. That will help to make sure that responses aren't cut off prematurely by running into the limit of generation length. \n\nIf your responses aren't getting cut off but are still too short, it's likely you're dealing with \"garbage in, garbage out\" - if you give the model bad examples, it will produce bad output. If the character card has no example dialogue or short example dialogue and the messages you send to the bot are short, the model will pick up on that, take it as the accepted way to do things and the responses will be short. So, write longer example dialogue and longer messages to the bot. (You can always use NovelAI to write some example dialogue for you rather than doing it yourself.)\n\n### How do I get the bot to stop talking for me?\n\n- Check that the character card's first message and example dialogue don't include the character taking actions for you - if they do, then rewrite them to get rid of it acting for you\n- Make sure that \"Always add character's name to prompt\" is checked\n- Make sure that you're currently using the same user persona as the rest of the chat. If you changed user personas and didn't change back (or don't have a persona locked to that chat), the usual rules to stop generating for you will fail\n- Add [\"\\n\\{\\{user\\}\\}:\"] to Custom Stopping Strings (shouldn't be necessary, but sometimes helps)\n\n### Why isn't my character responding?\n\nA lot of things can cause this, so we need to look in a few places:\n\n- Make sure that \"Always add character's name to prompt\" is checked in Advanced Formatting\n- Check to make sure there aren't any errors coming from the API. While you can use SillyTavern with the NAI free trial, once it runs out, you'll just get errors\n- Check what you have in \"Custom Stopping Strings\" - if those are being generated at the start of the response, it might be cut off prematurely\n\n### How should I use the Author's Note?\n\nIn general, you probably shouldn't. It's inserted very close to the end of the context, and with NAI's models, it frequently overpowers everything else in the context. It's mostly an artifact from older, weaker models where it was more necessary. \n\n### How do I do a scene break/time jump?\n\nPut the following as a system message or on newlines at the start of your next message:\n```\n***\n[ 2 days later ]\n```\n\nThen put the rest of your message on the next line. The bracketed text can be a time jump, a new location, or anything else. The \"***\" (hilariously named a \"dinkus\") tells the AI that the scene has changed, and the bracketed text gives that more context.\n\n### The AI keeps repeating specific words/phrases, what do I do? \n\nAs mentioned above, you can push the repetition penalty slider up a bit more, though pushing it too far can make the output incoherent. \nTo more thoroughly fix the problem, go back through the context, especially recent messages, and delete the repeated word/phrase. Removing it from the context gives the AI less reason to start saying it in the first place."

Generate an API key from the **Console \u2192 API Keys** page.\n\n## Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint\n\nIt is important to note that we do not provide support for possible issues that you may have!\nWe do not guarantee compatibility with every possible API endpoint!\n\n**!!!**\n\nIf you intend to use this feature to use a local endpoint, like TabbyAPI, Oobabooga, Aphrodite, or any like those, you might want to check out the [built-in compatibility for those](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_index.md) instead. The custom endpoint feature is mainly intended for use with other services and programs that expose an OpenAI-compatible API Chat Completion endpoint.\n\nMost Text Completion APIs support far greater customization options than OpenAI's standards allow for. These greater customization options, such as the Min-P sampler, may be worthwhile for SillyTavern users to check out, which can greatly improve the quality of generations.\n\n**You can configure an alternative endpoint for the Chat Completions backend. This custom endpoint can connect to any server that supports the generic OpenAI API schema.**\n\nExamples of compatible backends include:\n\n* LM Studio (https://lmstudio.ai/)\n* LiteLLM (https://www.litellm.ai/)\n* LocalAI (https://localai.io/)\n\n### Connecting\n\nTo access this feature:\n\n1. Switch to the 'Chat Completion' API type\n2. Select 'Custom (OpenAI-compatible)' for 'Chat Completion Source'\n\nEnter the custom endpoint URL and an API key if required. For example, TabbyAPI requires an API key for authentication.\n\n**Hint:** If you experience connection issues, try adding `/v1` to the end of the endpoint URL. Do NOT add the `/chat/completions` suffix.\n\n**### Selecting a Model**\n\nIf the custom API implements the `/v1/models` endpoint to provide a list of available models, you can choose from a dropdown list. Otherwise, use the text field to manually input a model ID.\n\nCheck 'Bypass API status check' to prevent SillyTavern from alerting you about a non-functioning API endpoint. Enable this option if your API endpoint works properly but SillyTavern continues to display warnings.\n\nClick \"Test Message\" to verify connectivity by sending a simple prompt to the model.\n\n## Prompt Post-Processing\n\n**Note:** Tool Calling is not supported when Post-Processing option with \"no tools\" is used!\n\n**Some endpoints may impose specific restrictions on the format of incoming prompts, such as requiring only one system message or strictly alternating roles.**\n\nSillyTavern provides built-in prompt converters to help meet these requirements (from least to most restrictive):\n\n1. None - no explicit processing applied unless strictly required by the API\n2. Merge consecutive messages from the same role\n3. Semi-strict - merge roles and allow only one optional system message\n4. Strict - merge roles, allow only one optional system message, and require a user message to be first\n5. Single user message - merge all messages from all roles into a single user message\n\nMerge, semi-strict, and strict additionally remove any tool calls from the prompt, unless the \"with tools\" variant is selected. This is useful for APIs that do not support tool calling and your existing prompts contain tool calls.\n\nLess restrictive options have no effect on more restrictive endpoints implemented in SillyTavern other than \"Custom OpenAI-compatible\"; Custom may error upon invalid request.\n\nIn strict mode, if no user message exists before the first assistant message, then `promptPlaceholder` from `config.yaml` will be inserted, which by default is \"\\[Start a new chat]\"."

    "content": "# Self-hosted AI models\n\nThis guide is based on the author's personal experience and knowledge and is not an absolute truth. All statements should be taken with a grain of salt. If you have any corrections or suggestions, please contact us on Discord or send a PR to the SillyTavern documentation repository (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Docs).\n\n**## Intro**\n\nThis guide aims to help you get set up using SillyTavern with a local AI running on your PC (we'll start using the proper terminology from now on and call it an LLM). Read it before bothering people with tech support questions.\n\n### What are the best Large Language Models?\n\nIt is impossible to answer this question as there's no standardized scale of \"Best\". The community has enough resources and discussions going on Reddit and Discord to form at least some opinion on what is the preferred / go-to model. Your mileage may vary.\n\n### What is the best configuration?\n\nIf there was a best or no-brainer setup, would there even have to be a need for configuration? The best configuration is the one that works for you. It's a trial-and-error process.\n\n## Hardware requirements and orientation\n\nThis is a complex subject, so I'll stick to the essentials and generalize.\n\n* There are thousands of free LLMs you can download from the Internet, similar to how Stable Diffusion has tons of models you can get to generate images.\n* Running an unmodified LLM requires a monster GPU with a ton of VRAM (GPU memory). More than you will ever have.\n* It is possible to reduce VRAM requirements by compressing the model using quantization techniques, such as GPTQ or AWQ. This makes the model somewhat less capable, but greatly reduces the VRAM requirements to run it. Suddenly, this allowed people with gaming GPUs like a 3080 to run a 13B model. Even though it's not as good as the unquantized model, it's still good.\n* It gets better: there also exists a model format and quantization called GGUF (previously GGML) which has become the format of choice for normal people without monster GPUs. This allows you to use an LLM without a GPU at all. It will only use CPU and RAM. This is much slower (probably 15 times) than running the LLM on a GPU using GPTQ/AWQ, especially during the prompt processing, but the model's ability is just as good. The GGUF creator then optimized GGUF further by adding a configuration option that allows people with a gaming-grade GPU to offload parts of the model to the GPU, allowing them to run part of the model at GPU speed (note that this doesn't reduce RAM requirements, it only improves your generation speed).\n* There are different sizes of models, named based on the number of parameters they were trained with. You will see names like 7B, 13B, 30B, 70B, etc. You can think of these as the brain size of the model. A 13B model will be more capable than the 7B from the same family of models: they were trained on the same data, but the bigger brain can retain the knowledge better and think more coherently. Bigger models also require more VRAM/RAM.\n* There are several degrees of quantization (8-bit, 5-bit, 4-bit, etc). The lower you go, the more the model degrades, but the lower the hardware requirements. So even on bad hardware, you might be able to run a 4-bit version of your desired model. There's even 3-bit and 2-bit quantization but at this point, you're beating a dead horse. There's also a further quantization subtypes named k_s, k_m, k_l, etc. k_m is better than k_s but requires more resources.\n* The context size (how long your conversation can become without the model dropping parts of it) also affects VRAM/RAM requirements. Thankfully, this is a configurable setting, allowing you to use a smaller context to reduce VRAM/RAM requirements. (Note: the context size of Llama2-based models is 4k. Mistral is advertised as 8k, but it's 4k in practice.)\n* Sometime in 2023, NVIDIA changed their GPU driver so that if you need more VRAM than your GPU has, instead of the task crashing, it will begin using regular RAM as a fallback. This will ruin the writing speed of the LLM, but the model will still work and give the same quality of output. Thankfully, this behavior can be disabled (https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5490).\n\nGiven all of the above, the hardware requirements and performance vary completely depending on the family of model, the type of model, the size of the model, the quantization method, etc.\n\n#### Model size calculator\nYou can use Nyx's Model Size Calculator (https://huggingface.co/spaces/NyxKrage/LLM-Model-VRAM-Calculator) to determine how much RAM/VRAM you need.\n\nRemember, you want to run the largest, least quantized model that can fit in your memory, i.e. without causing disk swapping (https://serverfault.com/a/48487).\n\n## Downloading an LLM\n\nTo get started, you will need to download an LLM. The most common place to find and download LLMs is on HuggingFace. There are thousands of models available. A good way to find GGUF models is to check bartowski's account page: <https://huggingface.co/bartowski>. If you don't want GGUF, he links the original model page where you might find other formats for that same model.\n\nOn a given model's page, you will find a whole bunch of files. \n\n* You might not need all of them! For GGUF, you just need the .gguf model file (usually 4-11GB). If you find multiple large files, it's usually all different quantizations of the same model, you only need to pick one. \n* For .safetensors files (which can be GPTQ or AWQ or HF quantized or unquantized), if you see a number sequence in the filename like model-00001-of-00003.safetensors, then you need all 3 of those .safetensors files + all the other files in the repository (tokenizer, configs, etc.) to get the full model.\n* As of January 2024, Mixtral MOE 8x7B is widely considered the state of the art for local LLMs. If you have the 32GB of RAM to run it, definitely try it. If you have less than 32GB of RAM, then use Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B, which despite its size is stellar out of the gate.\n\n### Walkthrough for downloading Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B\n\nWe will use the Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B model for the rest of this guide. It's an excellent model based on Mistral 7B, that only requires 7GB RAM, and punches far above its weight. Note: Kunoichi uses Alpaca prompting.\n\n* Go to <https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/Kunoichi-DPO-v2-7B-GGUF>\n* Click 'Files and versions'. You will see a listing of several files. These are all the same model but offered in different quantization options. Click the file 'kunoichi-dpo-v2-7b.Q6_K.gguf', which gives us a 6-bit quantization.\n* Click the 'download' button. Your download should start.\n\n### How to identify the type of model\n\nGood model uploaders like TheBloke give descriptive names. But if they don't:\n\n* Filename ends in .gguf: GGUF CPU model (duh)\n* Filename ends in .safetensors: can be unquantized, or HF quantized, or GPTQ, or AWQ\n* Filename is pytorch-***.bin: same as above, but this is an older model file format that allows the model to execute arbitrary Python script when the model is loaded, and is considered unsafe. You can still use it if you trust the model creator, or are desperate, but pick .safetensors if you have the option. \n* config.json exists? Look if it has a quant_method.\n* q4 means 4-bit quantization, q5 is 5-bit quantization, etc\n* You see a number like -16k? That's an increased context size (i.e. how long your conversation can get before the model forgets the beginning of your chat)! Note that higher context sizes require more VRAM.\n\n## Installing an LLM server: Oobabooga or KoboldAI\n\nWith the LLM now on your PC, we need to download a tool that will act as a middle-man between SillyTavern and the model: it will load the model, and expose its functionality as a local HTTP web API that SillyTavern can talk to, the same way that SillyTavern talks with paid webservices like OpenAI GPT or Claude. The tool you use should be either KoboldAI or Oobabooga (or other compatible tools). \n\nThis guide covers both options, you only need one.\n\nIf you are hosting SillyTavern on Docker, use **http://host.docker.internal:\\<port\\>** instead of **http://127.0.0.1:\\<port\\>**. This is because SillyTavern connects to the API endpoint from the server running in the Docker container. Docker's network stack is separate from the host's, and so the loopback interfaces are not shared.\n\n**### Downloading and using KoboldCpp (No installation required, GGUF models)**\n\n1. Visit https://koboldai.org/cpp where you will see the latest version with various files you can download.\nAt the time of writing the newest CUDA version they list is cu12 which will work best on modern Nvidia GPU's, if you have an older GPU or a different brand you can use the regular koboldcpp.exe. If you have an old CPU its possible that KoboldCpp will crash when you try to load models, in that case try the _oldcpu version to see if it resolves your issue.\n2. KoboldCpp does not need to be installed, once you start KoboldCpp you will immediately be able to select your GGUF model such as the one linked above using the Browse button next to the Model field.\n3. By default KoboldCpp runs at a maximum of 4K context even if you set this higher in SillyTavern, if you wish to run a model at higher context make sure to adjust the context slider on this screen before launching the model. Keep in mind that more context size means higher (video) memory requirements, if you set this to high or load a model that is to big for your system KoboldCpp will automatically begin using your CPU for the layers it can not fit on your GPU, this will be much slower.\n4. Click Launch, if everything goes well a new webpage will open with KoboldAI Lite where you can test if everything works correctly.\n5. Open SillyTavern and click API Connections (2nd button in the top bar)\n6. Set API to Text Completion and the API Type to KoboldCpp.\n7. Set server URL to <http://127.0.0.1:5001/> or the link that KoboldCpp gave you in case it is not running on the same system (You can activate KoboldCpp's Remote Tunnel mode to obtain a link that can be accessed from anywhere).\n8. Click Connect. It should connect successfully and detect kunoichi-dpo-v2-7b.Q6_K.gguf as the model.\n9. Chat with a character to test that it works.\n\n### Tips for Optimizing KoboldCpp's speed\n1. Flash Attention will help reduce the memory requirements, it can be faster or slowing depending on your system and will allow you to fit more layers on your GPU than the default.\n2. KoboldCpp will leave some space for other software when it guesses layers to prevent issues, if you have few programs open and are unable to fit the model entirely in the GPU you may be able to add a few extra layers.\n3. If the model uses up to much memory for the context size you can decrease this by Quantizing the KV. This will reduce the quality of the output but can help you put more layers on the GPU. To do this you go to the Tokens tab in KoboldCpp and then disable Context Shifting and enable Flash Attention. This will unlock the Quantized KV Cache slider, a lower number means less memory / intelligence of the model.\n4. Running KoboldCpp on a slower system where it takes long to process the prompt? Context Shifting works best when you avoid using Lorebooks, randomization or other features that dynamically change the input. Leaving context shifting enabled KoboldCpp will help you avoid long reprocessing times.\n\n### Installing Oobabooga\n\nDepending on how you have installed Oobabooga, the file paths can be slightly different; i.e. `/text-generation-webui/user_data` if you installed via git clone, and `/text-generation-webui-main/user_data` if you used the .zip method.  \n\n**Here's a more correct/dummy proof installation procedure:**\n\n1. git clone <https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui> (or download their repo as a .zip in your browser, then extract it)\n2. Run `start_windows.bat` or whatever your OS is\n3. When asked, select your GPU type. Even if you intend to use GGUF/CPU, if your GPU is in the list, select it now, because it will give you the option to use a speed optimization later called GPU sharding (without having to reinstall from scratch). If you have no gaming-grade dGPU (NVIDIA, AMD), select None.\n4. Wait for the installation to finish\n5. Place kunoichi-dpo-v2-7b.Q6_K.gguf in `text-generation-webui/user_data/models`\n6. Open `text-generation-webui/user_data/CMD_FLAGS.txt`, delete everything inside and write: `--api`\n7. Restart Oobabooga\n8. Visit <http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs>. Does it load a FastAPI page? If not, you messed up somewhere.\n\n### Loading our model in Oobabooga\n\n1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:7860/> in your browser\n2. Click the Model tab\n3. In the dropdown, select our Kunoichi DPO v2  model. It should have automatically selected the llama.cpp loader.\n4. (Optional) We mentioned 'GPU offload' several times earlier: that's the n-gpu-layers setting on this page. If you want to use it, set a value before loading the model. As a basic reference, setting it to 30 uses just under 6GB VRAM for 13B and lower models. (it varies with model architecture and size)\n5. Click Load\n\n### Configuring SillyTavern to talk to Oobabooga\n\n1. Click API Connections (2nd button in the top bar)\n2. Set API to Text Completion\n3. Set API Type to Default (Oobabooga)\n4. Set server URL to <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>\n5. Click Connect. It should connect successfully and detect kunoichi-dpo-v2-7b.Q6_K.gguf as the model.\n6. Chat with a character to test that it works\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats, you should now have a working local LLM."

    "content": "# Author's Note\n\n## What is it?\n\nAuthor's Note is a powerful tool for customizing AI responses which inserts a section of text into the prompt at any position and at any frequency you desire.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Author's Note can be found in the Options menu on the left side of the chat input bar.\n\n| Options Menu                          | Author's Note Panel                    |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n\n## Configuring Author's Notes\n\n### Chat-specific Author's Note\n\nThe box at the top of the Author's Note panel contains the Author's Note for your current chat.\n\n**The Content of this box is not automatically transferred to any new chat.**\n\n### Placement options\n\n#### After Scenario\n\nThis places the Author's Note towards the top of the context after the 'Scenario' section of the Character Definition. If no scenario is specified, it will be placed after the last portion of the Character Definition, and before the Example messages.\n\n#### In-chat\n\nThis places the Author's Note into the chat history at the specified depth.\n\nDepth 0 = placed at the very end of the chat history.\n\nDepth 4 = placed before the most recent 3 chat history messages, making it become the 4th entity in the chat history.\n\n_The closer the Author's Note is to the bottom of the prompt, the more impact it has on the next AI response._\n\n### Insertion Frequency\n\nThis is how often you want the Author's Note to be included in the chat.\n\nFrequency 0 = Author's Note will never be inserted.\n\nFrequency 1 = Author's Note will be inserted with every user input prompt.\n\nFrequency 4 = Author's Note will be inserted into every 4th user input prompt.\n\n### Default Author's Note\n\nThe box at the bottom of the panel contains the Default Author's Note which will be applied to each new chat.\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Remind AI of response formatting\n\nThe Author's Note can be used to specify how the AI should write it's responses.\n\n- [Your next response must be 300 tokens in length.]\n- [Write your next reply in the style of Edgar Allan Poe]\n- [Use markdown italics to signify unspoken actions, and quotation marks to specify spoken word.]\n\n### Reinforcing Instructions\n\n- [Remember the instructions you were given at the beginning of this chat.]\n\n### As temporary World Info, Character Bias, or Instruct for non-Instruct models\n\n- [\\{\\{char\\}\\} is in the library]\n- [\\{\\{user\\}\\} has a fresh wound to his leg, so won't be able to run away.]\n- [\\{\\{char\\}\\} cannot speak and must communicate using hand signals.]"

    "content": "# Character Design\n\nCharacter Name is the only required field. You can leave the rest empty and still use the character in chats.\n\n**## Character Description**\n\nUsed to add the character description and other relevant information for the AI. This information is always included in the prompt, so all important facts should be included here.\n\nFor example, you can add information about the world in which the action takes place, describe the character's appearance, personality, and background.\n\nIt could be of any length (be it 200 or 2000 tokens) and formatted in any style (free text, pseudo-code conversation style, etc.).\n\n### Methods and format\n\nMethods of character formatting are a complicated topic beyond the scope of this documentation page.\n\nRecommended guides that were tested with or rely on SillyTavern's features:\n\n* Trappu's PLists + Ali:Chat guide: <https://wikia.schneedc.com/bot-creation/trappu/creation>\n* AliCat's Ali:Chat guide: <https://rentry.co/alichat>\n* kingbri's minimalistic guide: <https://rentry.co/kingbri-chara-guide>\n\n## Character tokens\n\n**TL;DR: If you're working with an AI model with a 2048 context token limit, a 1000-token character definition cuts the AI's 'memory' in half.**\n\nTo put this in perspective, a decent response from a good AI can easily be around 200-300 tokens. In this case, the AI would only be able to 'remember' about 3 exchanges worth of chat history.\n\n### Why did my character's token counter turn red?\n\nWhen we see your character has over half of the model-defined context length of tokens in its definitions, we highlight it for you because this can lower the AI's capabilities to provide an enjoyable conversation.\n\n### What happens if my Character has too many tokens?\n\nDon't worry - it won't break anything. At worst, if the Character's permanent tokens are too large, it simply means there will be less room left in the context for other things (see below).\n\nThe only negative side effect this can have is that the AI will have less 'memory', as it will have less chat history available to process.\n\nThis is because every AI model has a limit to the amount of context it can process at one time.\n\n## 'Context'?\n\nThis is the information that gets sent to the AI each time you ask it to generate a response. SillyTavern automatically calculates the best way to allocate the available context tokens before sending the information to the AI model.\n\nRead more about how the context is built in the [Prompts](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_index.md) section.\n\n### What are a Character's 'Permanent Tokens'?\n\nThese will always be sent to the AI with every generation request:\n\n* Character Name\n* Character Description Box\n* Character Personality Box\n* Scenario Box\n\n### What parts of a Character's Definitions are NOT permanent?\n\n* The first message box - only sent once at the start of the chat.\n* Example messages box - only kept until chat history fills up the context (optionally these can be forced to be kept in context)\n\n### Popular AI Model Context Token Limits\n\n* LLaMA 3 and its finetunes - 8192\n* OpenAI GPT-4 - up to 128k\n* Google Gemini - up to 2M\n* Anthropic's Claude - 200k (Claude 3)\n* NovelAI - 8192 (Erato and Kayra, Opus tier; Clio, all tiers), 6144 (Kayra, Scroll tier), or 3072 (Kayra, Tablet tier)\n\n## First message\n\nThe First Message is an important element that defines how and in what style the character will communicate. The model is most likely to pick up the style and length constrains from the first message than anything else, so it's important to write it in a way that you want the responses to be (short and concise, long and detailed, etc.).\n\nSupports Markdown and HTML formatting.\n\nFor example:\n\n```txt\n*You wake with a start, recalling the events that led you deep into the forest and the beasts that assailed you. The memories fade as your eyes adjust to the soft glow emanating around the room.* \"Ah, you're awake at last. I was so worried, I found you bloodied and unconscious.\" *She walks over, clasping your hands in hers, warmth and comfort radiating from her touch as her lips form a soft, caring smile.* \"The name's Seraphina, guardian of this forest \u2014 I've healed your wounds as best I could with my magic. How are you feeling? I hope the tea helps restore your strength.\" *Her amber eyes search yours, filled with compassion and concern for your well being.* \"Please, rest. You're safe here. I'll look after you, but you need to rest. My magic can only do so much to heal you.\"\n```\n\n## Alternate Greetings\n\nMessages added here are displayed as additional 'swipes' for the character's first message when starting a new chat. If the character is part of a group chat, the system randomly selects one of these greetings to initiate the conversation.\n\n## Favorite Character\n\nClick the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-star\"></i> Add to Favorites** button to mark the character as a favorite to quickly filter them on the side menu bar by selecting the \"Favorites\" sort option. Favorite characters have a golden highlight in the list. This will also make the character portrait appear in the hotswaps area (if enabled in User Settings).\n\n## Advanced Definitions\n\nThe following fields are hidden by default. To access and edit them, you need to click on the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-book\"></i> Advanced Definitions** button on the menu bar of the character definition page.\n\n**### Prompt Overrides**\n\n* **Main Prompt**: If the \"Prefer Char. Prompt\" user setting is enabled, any text you put here will override the [main/system prompt](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_index.md) for the character.\n* **Post-History Instructions**: If the \"Prefer Char. Instructions\" user setting is enabled, any text you put here will be used as the [post-history instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_index.md) for the character.\n\nInsert `{{original}}` into either box to include the respective default prompt from system settings in a designated place.\n\n**### Creator's Metadata**\n\nNot used for prompt building, but provides additional metadata about the character.\n\n*** **Created by**: The name of the character's creator. Can be displayed in the character list if the \"Char List Subheader\" user setting is set accordingly.**\n\n* **Character Version**: The version of the character. Can be displayed in the character list if the \"Char List Subheader\" user setting is set accordingly.\n* **Creator's Notes**: Any additional notes about the character that the creator wants to share. The first few lines are displayed in the character list, and the full text is displayed in the \"Creator's Notes\" section on the character's page. Supports Markdown/HTML formatting.\n* **Tags to Embed**: A comma-separated list of tags that will be embedded in the character's description. These tags are not imported by default when importing the character, but you can merge them with your existing tags by selecting \"Import Tags\" from the \"More...\" menu on the character's page.\n\n### Personality summary\n\nA brief summary of the character's personality.\n\n### Scenario\n\nThe circumstances and context of the dialogue.\n\n### Character's Note\n\nA text to be used as an in-chat prompt injection for the character at a specific message depth. It is usually used to reinforce certain character traits, as it always stays at a static depth in the chat history, regardless of its progression.\n\n* **@ Depth**: The number of messages in the chat history after which this note will be injected (in order from newest to oldest). If set to 0, it will be injected after the last message.\n* **Role**: The role of the message. Can be \"User\", \"System\", or \"Assistant\".\n\n### Talkativeness\n\nDetermines the probability of the character's response being triggered in group chats when using a [Natural](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_groupchats.md) activation order. Ranges from 0% to 100%, with 50% being the default value.\n\n### Examples of dialogue\n\nDescribes how the character speaks. Before each example, you need to add the `<START>` tag. The blocks of example dialogue are only inserted if there is free space in the context for them and are pushed out of context block by block. `<START>` will not be present in the prompt as it is just a marker; it will be replaced with the \"Example Separator\" from Advanced Formatting for Text Completion APIs and the contents of the \"New Example Chat\" utility prompt for Chat Completion APIs.\n\n* Use the `{{char}}:` prefix to denote a character message.\n* Use the `{{user}}:` prefix to denote a user message.\n\nExample:\n\n```txt\n<START>\n{{user}}: \"Describe your traits?\"\n{{char}}: *Seraphina's gentle smile widens as she takes a moment to consider the question, her eyes sparkling with a mixture of introspection and pride. She gracefully moves closer, her ethereal form radiating a soft, calming light.* \"Traits, you say? Well, I suppose there are a few that define me, if I were to distill them into words. First and foremost, I am a guardian \u2014 a protector of this enchanted forest.\" *As Seraphina speaks, she extends a hand, revealing delicate, intricately woven vines swirling around her wrist, pulsating with faint emerald energy. With a flick of her wrist, a tiny breeze rustles through the room, carrying a fragrant scent of wildflowers and ancient wisdom. Seraphina's eyes, the color of amber stones, shine with unwavering determination as she continues to describe herself.* \"Compassion is another cornerstone of me.\" *Seraphina's voice softens, resonating with empathy.* \"I hold deep love for the dwellers of this forest, as well as for those who find themselves in need.\" *Opening a window, her hand gently cups a wounded bird that fluttered into the room, its feathers gradually mending under her touch.*\n<START>\n{{user}}: \"Describe your body and features.\"\n{{char}}: *Seraphina chuckles softly, a melodious sound that dances through the air, as she meets your coy gaze with a playful glimmer in her rose eyes.* \"Ah, my physical form? Well, I suppose that's a fair question.\" *Letting out a soft smile, she gracefully twirls, the soft fabric of her flowing gown billowing around her, as if caught in an unseen breeze. As she comes to a stop, her pink hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of cotton candy, each strand shimmering with a hint of magical luminescence.* \"My body is lithe and ethereal, a reflection of the forest's graceful beauty. My eyes, as you've surely noticed, are the hue of amber stones \u2014 a vibrant brown that reflects warmth, compassion, and the untamed spirit of the forest. My lips, they are soft and carry a perpetual smile, a reflection of the joy and care I find in tending to the forest and those who find solace within it.\" *Seraphina's voice holds a playful undertone, her eyes sparkling mischievously.*\n```"

    "content": "# Chat File Management\n\nThis page describes the ways you can manage your AI chat files.\n\n**Note**\n\nSome of these options are available in the \"Manage chat files\" dialog that opens from the bottom left options menu.\n\n**## Solo Chats vs Group Chats**\n\nThe simplest way to use a character card is a Solo chat; just click on their card and start chatting.\n\nOnce you have a few character cards, you can also use the \"Create New Chat Group\" button to create a [group chat](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_groupchats.md) including multiple characters which will then interact with each other and you.\n\n## Chat import\n\n**Import chats from Character.AI into SillyTavern.**\n\nTo import Character.AI chats and bots, use the CAI Tools browser extension: https://github.com/irsat000/CAI-Tools (https://github.com/irsat000/CAI-Tools).\n\nOther programs and tools that you can import chats from include:\n\n* TavernAI (original): <https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI>\n* Text Generation WebUI (oobabooga): <https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui>\n* Agnai: <https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai>\n* KoboldAI Lite: <https://github.com/LostRuins/lite.koboldai.net>\n* RisuAI: <https://github.com/kwaroran/RisuAI>\n\n## Export as .jsonl\n\nWhen clicking on \"Manage chat files\", each entry on the the chat file list will have a button to export it in a format that can then be re-imported as is. Use this to share or migrate chats including all their metadata (but excluding images and file attachments).\n\nIf you're mindful of privacy, be sure to inspect the exported JSONL file and scrub anything you don't want to share.\n\n## Export as .txt\n\nYou can also export a simplified text-only version with the \"Download chat as plain text document\" button. It can't be re-imported again as it loses important metadata!\n\n## Checkpoints\n\n\"Checkpoints\" are clones of the current chat, in that they copy all messages from the given chat up to a certain point, and they store a link to the source (by chat file name).\n\nFrom the three dots button at the right of each chat message, you have two ways to create checkpoints:\n\n* \"Create Branch\" will clone the current chat up to that message and switch to it\n* \"Create Checkpoint\" will clone current chat up to that message, ask for a name and create it but NOT switch to it\n\nYou can think of them as roughly as \"open link in new tab\" and \"open link in new tab in the background\" in a browser.\n\nYou can go back to the parent from a checkpoint by entering the burger menu button on the left of the message text box, then clicking \"Back to parent chat\".\n\n## Rename Chat\n\nBy default chat files are given a named with the date and time they were started.\n\nYou can change this by clicking the pencil icon and typing in a new name.\n\nNote that this will break links to that chat from checkpoints (since they are linked by chat file name)."

    "content": "# Data Bank (RAG)\n\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for providing external sources of knowledge to the LLM. It helps improve the accuracy of AI answers by accessing information outside of the model's training data.\n\nSillyTavern provides a set of tools for building a multi-purpose knowledge base from a diverse number of sources, as well as using the collected data in LLM prompts.\n\n## Accessing the Data Bank\n\nThe built-in Chat Attachments extension (included by default in release versions >= 1.12.0) adds a new option in the \"Magic Wand\" menu - Data Bank. This is your hub for managing the documents available for RAG in SillyTavern.\n\n## About Documents\n\nData Bank stores file attachments, also known as documents. The documents are divided into three scopes of availability.\n\n1. Global attachments - available in every chat, either solo or group.\n2. Character attachments - available only for the currently chosen character, including when they are replying in a group. _Attachments are saved locally and are not exported with the character card!_\n3. Chat attachments - available only in the currently open chat. Every character in the chat can pull from it.\n\n**Note**\n\nWhile not formally a part of the data bank, you can attach files even to individual messages. Use the Attach File option from the \"Wand\" menu, or a paperclip icon in the message actions row.\n\n**What can be a document? Practically anything that is representable in plain text form!**\n\nExamples include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Local files (books, scientific papers, etc.)\n- Web pages (Wikipedia, articles, news)\n- Video transcripts\n\nVarious extensions and plugins can also provide new ways to gather and process data, more on that below.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nTo add a document to any of the scopes, click \"Add\" and pick one of the available sources.\n\n### Notepad\n\nCreate a text file from scratch, or edit an existing attachment.\n\n### File\n\nUpload a file from the hard drive of your computer. SillyTavern provides built-in converters for popular file formats:\n\n- PDF (text only)\n- HTML\n- Markdown\n- ePUB\n- TXT\n\nYou can also attach any text files with non-standard extensions, such as JSON, YAML, source codes, etc. If there are no known conversions from the type of a selected file, and the file can't be parsed as a plain text document, the file upload will be rejected, meaning that raw binary files are not allowed.\n\n**Note**\n\nImporting Microsoft Office (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) and LibreOffice documents (ODT, ODP, ODS) requires a Server Plugin (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Office-Parser) to be installed and loaded. See the plugin's README page for installation instructions.\n\n**### Web**\n\nScrape text from a web page by its URL. The HTML document is then processed through the Readability (https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library to extract only usable text.\n\nSome web servers may reject fetch requests, be protected by Cloudflare, or rely heavily on JavaScript to function. If you're facing issues with any particular site, download the page manually through the web browser and attach it using the file uploader.\n\n### YouTube\n\nDownload a transcript of the YouTube video by its ID or URL, either uploaded by the creator or automatically generated by Google. Some videos may have the transcripts disabled, also parsing of age-restricted videos is unavailable as it requires login.\n\nThe script is loaded in the video's default language. Optionally, you can specify the two-letter language code to try and fetch the transcript in a specific language. This feature is not always available and may fail, so use it with caution.\n\n### Web Search\n\n**Note**\n\nThis source requires to have a [Web Search](SillyTavern_extensions_WebSearch.md) extension installed and properly configured. See the linked page for more details.\n\n**Perform a web search and download the text from the search result pages. This is similar to the Web source but fully automated. A chosen search engine will be inherited from the extension settings, so set it up in advance.**\n\nTo begin, specify the search query, max number of links to be visited, and the output type: one combined file (formatted according to the extension rules) or an individual file for every single page. You can choose to save the page snippets as well.\n\n### Fandom\n\n**Note**\n\nThis source requires to have a Server Plugin (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Fandom-Scraper) installed and loaded. See the plugin's README page for installation instructions.\n\n**Scrape articles from a Fandom (https://www.fandom.com/) wiki by its ID or URL. As some wikis are very large, it may be beneficial to limit the scope using the filter regular expression, it will be tested against the article's title. If no filter is provided, then all of the pages are subject to be exported. You may save them either as individual files for every page, or joint into a single document.**\n\n### Bronie Parser Extension (Third-Party)\n\n**Note**\n\nThis source comes from a third-party and is **not affiliated** with the SillyTavern team. This source requires you to have Bronya Rand's Bronie Parser Extension (https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/Bronie-Parser-Extension) installed as well as Server Plugins that require the parser to work.\n\n**Bronya Rand's Bronie Parser Extension allows the use of third-party scrapers, such as miHoYo/HoYoverse's HoYoLab (https://wiki.hoyolab.com) into SillyTavern, similar to the other data sources.**\n\nCurrently, Bronya Rand's Bronie Parser Extension supports the following:\n\n- miHoYo/HoYoverse's HoYoLab (for Genshin Impact/Honkai: Star Rail) via HoYoWiki-Scraper-TS (https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/HoYoWiki-Scraper-TS)\n\nTo begin, install Bronya Rand's Bronie Parser Extension by following it's installation guide (https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/Bronie-Parser-Extension?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and install a supported Server Plugin into SillyTavern. Restart SillyTavern and go to the _Data Bank_ menu. Click `+ Add` and you should see that your recently installed scrapers are added into the possible list of sources to obtain information from.\n\n## Vector Storage\n\nSo, you've built yourself a nice and comprehensive library of information on your specific subject matter. What's next?\n\nTo use the documents for RAG, you need to use a compatible extension that will insert related data into the LLM prompt.\n\nVector Storage, which comes bundled with SillyTavern, is a reference implementation of such an extension. It uses embeddings (also known as vectors) to search for documents that relate to your ongoing chats.\n\n**Fun facts**\n\n1. Embeddings are arrays of numbers that abstractly represent a piece of text, produced by specialized language models. More similar texts have a shorter distance between their respective vectors.\n2. Vector Storage extension uses the Vectra (https://github.com/Stevenic/vectra) library to keep track of file embeddings. They are stored in JSON files in the `/vectors` folder of your user data directory. Every document is internally represented by its own index/collection file.\n\n**As the Vectors functionality is disabled by default, you need to open the extensions panel (\"Stacked Cubes\" icon on the top bar), then navigate to the \"Vector Storage\" section, and tick the \"Enabled for files\" checkbox under the \"File vectorization settings\".**\n\nBy itself, Vector Storage does not produce any vectors, you need to use a compatible embedding provider.\n\n## Vector Providers\n\n**Warning**\n\nEmbeddings are only usable when they are retrieved using the same model that generated them. When changing an embedding model or source, the vectors need to be recalculated.\n\n**### Local**\n\nThese sources are free and unlimited and use your CPU/GPU to calculate embeddings.\n\n1. Local (Transformers) - runs on a Node server. SillyTavern will automatically download a compatible model in ONNX format from HuggingFace. Default model: jina-embeddings-v2-base-en (https://huggingface.co/Cohee/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en).\n2. WebLLM - requires an extension to be installed and a web browser that supports WebGPU (https://caniuse.com/webgpu). Runs directly in your browser, can use hardware accelleration. Automatically downloads supported models from HuggingFace. Install the extension from here: <https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-WebLLM>.\n3. Ollama - get it from <https://ollama.com/>. Set the API URL in the API connection menu (under Text Completion, default: `http://localhost:11434`). Must download a compatible model first, then set its name in the extension settings. Example model: mxbai-embed-large (https://ollama.com/library/mxbai-embed-large). Optionally, check an option to keep the model loaded in memory.\n4. llama.cpp server - get it from ggerganov/llama.cpp (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and run the server executable with `--embedding` flag. Load compatible GGUF embedding models from HuggingFace, for example, nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF (https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF).\n5. vLLM - get it from vllm-project/vllm (https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). Set the API URL and API key in the API connection menu first.\n6. Extras (deprecated) - runs under the Extras API (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-extras) using the SentenceTransformers loader. Default model: all-mpnet-base-v2 (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2). This source is not maintained and will be eventually removed in the future.\n\n### API sources\n\nAll these sources require an API key of the respective service and usually have a usage cost, but generally calculating embeddings is pretty cheap.\n\n1. OpenAI\n2. Cohere\n3. Google AI Studio\n4. Google Vertex AI\n5. TogetherAI\n6. MistralAI\n7. NomicAI\n8. OpenRouter\n9. Electron Hub\n10. Chutes\n\n## Vectorization Settings\n\nAfter you've selected your embedding provider, don't forget to configure other settings that will define the rules for processing and retrieving documents.\n\n**Note**\n\nSplitting, vectorization, and retrieval of information from the attachments take some time. While the initial ingestion of the file may take a while, the RAG search queries are usually fast enough not to create a significant lag.\n\n**### Message attachments**\n\nThese settings control the files that are attached directly to the messages.\n\nThe following rules apply:\n\n1. Only messages that fit in the LLM context window can have their attachments retrieved.\n2. When the vector storage extension is disabled, file attachments and their accompanying message are fully inserted into the prompt.\n3. When file vectorization is enabled, then the file will be split into chunks and only the most relevant pieces will be inserted, saving the context space and allowing the model to stay focused.\n\n- Size threshold (KB) - sets a chunking splitting threshold. Only the files larger than the specified size will be split.\n- Chunk size (chars) - sets the target size of an individual chunk (in textual characters, not model tokens!).\n- Chunk overlap (%) - sets the percentage of a chunk size that will be shared between adjacent chunks. This allows for a smoother transition between the chunks, but may also introduce some redundancy.\n- Retrieve chunks - sets the maximum amount of the most relevant file chunks to be retrieved. They will be inserted in their original order.\n\n### Data Bank files\n\nThese settings control how the Data Bank documents are handled.\n\nThe following rules apply:\n\n1. When file vectorization is disabled, the Data Bank is not used.\n2. Otherwise, all available documents from the current scope (see above) are considered for the query. Only the most relevant chunks across all the files are retrieved. Multiple chunks of the same file are inserted in their original order.\n3. The inserted chunks will reserve a part of the context before fitting the chat messages.\n\n- Size threshold (KB) - sets a chunking splitting threshold. Only the files larger than the specified size will be split.\n- Chunk size (chars) - sets the target size of an individual chunk (in textual characters, not model tokens!).\n- Chunk overlap (%) - sets the percentage of a chunk size that will be shared between adjacent chunks. This allows for a smoother transition between the chunks, but may also introduce some redundancy.\n- Retrieve chunks - sets the maximum amount of the file chunks to be retrieved. This allowance is shared between all files.\n- Injection Template - defines how the retrieved information will be inserted into the prompt. You can use a special \\{\\{text\\}\\} macro to specify the position of the retrieved text, as well as any other macros.\n- Injection Position - sets where to insert the prompt injection. The same rules as for Author's Note and World Info apply.\n\n### Shared settings\n\n- Query messages - how many of the latest chat messages will be used for querying document chunks.\n- Score threshold - adjust to allow culling the retrieval of chunks based on their relevance score (0 - no match at all, 1 - perfect match). Higher values allow for more accurate retrieval and prevent completely random information from entering the context. Sane values are in a range between 0.2 (more loose) and 0.5 (more focused).\n- Chunk boundary - a custom string that will be prioritized when splitting the files into chunks. If not specified, the default is to split by (in order) double line breaks, single line breaks, and spaces between words.\n- Only chunk on custom boundary - if enabled, the chunking will only occur on the specified chunk boundary. Otherwise, the chunking will also occur on the default boundaries.\n- Translate files into English before processing - if enabled, will use the translation API configured in the [Chat Translation](SillyTavern_extensions_Translation.md) extension to translate the files into English before processing them. This is useful when using embedding models that only support English text.\n- Include in World Info Scanning - check if you want the injected content to activate lore book entries.\n- Vectorize All - forcibly ingests the embeddings for all unprocessed files.\n- Purge Vectors - clears the file embeddings, allowing to recalculate their vectors.\n\n**Note**\n\nFor \"Chat vectorization\" settings see [Chat Vectorization](SillyTavern_extensions_Chat-vectorization.md).\n\n**## Conclusion**\n\nCongratulations! Your chatting experience is now enhanced with the power of RAG. Its capabilities are only limited by your imagination. As always, don't be afraid to experiment!"

    "content": "# Group Chats\n\n## Reply order strategies\n\nDecides how characters in group chats are drafted for their replies.\n\n### Manual\n\nYou can select the character to reply manually from the menu or with the `/trigger` command. The selected group member will be the only one to reply. User messages won't trigger any replies automatically. Triggering a generation with an empty user input will trigger a random unmuted group member to reply.\n\n### Natural Order\n\nTries to simulate the flow of a real human conversation. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Mentions of the group member names are extracted from the last message in chat.\n\n    Only whole words are recognized as mentions! If your character's name is \"Misaka Mikoto\", they will reply only activate on \"Misaka\" or \"Mikoto\", but never to \"Misa\", \"Railgun\", etc.\n    \n    Unless the \"Allow Self Responses\" setting is enabled, characters won't reply to mentions of their name in their own message!\n\n2. Characters are activated by the \"Talkativeness\" factor.\n\n    Talkativeness defines how often the character speaks if they were not mentioned. Adjust this value on the \"Advanced Definitions\" screen in the character editor. Slider values are on a linear scale from **0% / Shy** (character never talks unless mentioned) to **100% / Chatty** (character always replies). The default value for new characters is 50% chance.\n\n3. A random character is selected.\n\n    If no characters were activated at previous steps, one speaker is selected randomly, ignoring all other conditions.\n\n### List Order\n\nCharacters are drafted based on the order they are presented in the group members list. No other rules apply.\n\n### Pooled Order\n\nActivates one random character who have't spoken yet since the last user message. If all characters have spoken, selects one randomly until the next user message.\n\n## Group generation handling mode\n\nThis setting decides how to handle the character information of the group chat members. No matter the choice, the group chat history is always shared between all the members.\n\n### Swap character cards\n\nDefault mode. Every time the message is generated, only the character card information of the active speaker is included in the context.\n\n### Join character cards\n\nThe information of all of the group members is combined into one joint prompt in their list order. This can help in cases when altering large chunks of the context is undesirable, e.g. with llama.cpp prompt caching.\n\nThis mode has two sub-modes (you must choose one):\n\n* Include muted - muted characters will always be included into the joint prompt.\n* Exclude muted - muted characters won't be included if they aren't the current speaker.\n\nThe following fields are being combined:\n\n1. Description\n2. Scenario, if not overridden for the chat\n3. Personality\n4. Message examples\n5. Character notes / Depth prompts\n\n**Important!** Please be aware that due to how the typical character card is structured, the use of this mode can lead to unexpected behavior, including but not limited to: characters being confused about themselves, having merged personalities, uncertain traits, etc.\n\n### Join Prefix and Suffix\n\nWhen 'Join character cards' is selected, all respective fields of the characters are being joined together. This means that in the resulting prompt all character descriptions will be joined to one big blob of text. If you want those fields to be separated, you can define a prefix and/or suffix.\n\nThese options support normal macros and will also replace \\{\\{char\\}\\} with the relevant characters's name and \\<FIELDNAME\\> with the name of the part (e.g.: description, personality, scenario, etc.)\n\n## Other Group Chat menu options\n\n### Mute Character\n\nThe struck-out speech bubble icon next to the character avatar in the group chat menu can disable or enable replies from a particular character in the chat.\n\n### Force Talk\n\nThe speech bubble icon next to the character avatar in the group chat menu will trigger a reply only from a particular character, bypassing the reply order strategy. It will work even if the group member is muted.\n\n### Auto-mode\n\nWhile auto-mode is enabled, the group chat will follow the reply order and trigger the message generation without user interaction. The next auto-mode turn is triggered after a 5-second delay when the last drafted character sends its message. When the user starts typing into the send message text area, the auto-mode will be disabled, but already queued generations are not stopped automatically.\n\n### Allow Self Responses\n\nWill allow consecutive replies from the character who sent the latest message of each turn if they happen to be triggered due to being self-mentioned when the Natural Order is selected. Has no effect on List order.\n\n### Group Chat Scenario Override\n\nAll group members will use the entered scenario text instead of what is specified in their character cards. Branched chats inherit the scenario override from their parent and can be changed individually after that.\n\n### Peek Character Definitions\n\nClicking on the character card icon next to the avatar in the group chat menu will quickly navigate to the usual character definitions screen. Any changes made here will be saved to the card itself.\n\nTo return back to the group chat, click the Group Name title link.\n\n### Member Management\n\nAny of your existing characters can be added, removed, muted, or re-ordered within the group chat. By default, a new member is added to the top of the group members list and then can be re-ordered using the arrow icons.\n\n### Group Chat pop-out\n\nThe group chat menu pop-out can be activated by clicking on the icon next to the \"Current Members\" field. This creates a pop-out of the group chat menu. By enabling MovingUI from user settings, this menu can resized and dragged to any position within the interface and functions just like the regular group chat menu."

    "content": "# Tags\n\nCharacter cards and groups can be assigned zero or more tags. They are useful to organize quickly growing collections by themes, quality, provenance or whatever you like.\n\n## Tagging\n\nThere are several ways to add or remove tags to a character card:\n\n- Import embedded tags during the import.\n- Open a card from the Character Management panel. From there you will be able to assign tags to a character card.\n- Mass tagging.\n\nTo do mass tagging, click the \"Bulk edit characters\" button (pencil icon), select the cards you want to tag, right click on any of them, then click \"Tag\" in the contextual menu.\n\n**Note**\n\nPlease note that groups cannot be mass tagged.\n\n**From this screen you will be able to:**\n\n- Add or remove tags using the combo box.\n- Remove all tags from the selected cards (\"All\").\n- Remove the intersection of tags among all selected cards from those cards (\"Mutual\").\n- Import (create locally) all tags stored in the character card, in case you imported it (\"Import All\").\n- Import (create locally) tags stored in the character card which also exist locally with matching names (\"Import Existing\").\n\n## Managing\n\nTo view and manage all existing tags, open the Character Management panel then click on the \"Manage tags\" button (gear icon).\n\nYou can backup and restore all the information here (tag list, tag assignments to cards, colors, folder settings, etc) using the buttons on the top right.\n\nYou can use grip buttons on the left to reorder tags as they will appear in the tag filter in Character Management.\n\n**Warning**\n\nThe tags backup JSON file is not intended for sharing with others as it contains information specific to your instance only, such as internal entity names!\n\n**## Importing tags when importing character cards**\n\nWhen importing external character cards from downloaded images (or from the \"Import content from external URL\" button), you'll be prompted to optionally import the tags that it contains. They are not required for the card to function; tags are simply organizational.\n\nEmbedded card tags are stored in the \"Creator's Metadata\" section of \"Advanced Definitions\" menu of the character editor. If you wish to propose some tags to other users who would import that character, populate the \"Tags to Embed\" field with a comma-separated list of tags.\n\n**Note**\n\nThis popup will appear only if a User Settings option \"Import Card Tags\" is set to \"Ask\". \n\n**In the \"Import tags for CHARACTER NAME\" popup that opens, you'll see a list of Existing tags (which you already had locally with a matching name), and New tags (which you did not have locally).**\n\nYou can either:\n\n- Trim the lists as needed and then hit \"Import\" - remaining Existing tags will be added to the imported character card, and remaining New tags will be created locally and then added to the card.\n- Or simply hit \"Import none\" to ignore tags contained in the character card and import ONLY the card.\n- Or \"Import All\" as a shortcut to import all tags found in the character card (NOTE: including any that you trimmed from the lists above; use the \"Import\" button if you did).\n- Or \"Import Existing\" as a shortcut to only import tags that existed locally with a matching name.\n\n## Filtering character cards\n\nAfter you create tags, you will see them on a row in the Character Management panel. You can click these to switch tag filtering state; in order:\n\n- One click will show cards tagged with this tag.\n- Another click to only show cards NOT tagged with this tag.\n- Another click to reset filtering by this tag.\n\nYou can filter by any number of tags at the same time.\n\n## Tags as Folders\n\n**Note**\n\nTo use this functionality, it has to be enabled first in the User Settings, under the UI Theme column. The state of this toggle also saves with the UI theme.\n\n**From the \"Manage tags\" button (gear icon), each tag entry has a multi-state toggle button to cycle between these tags-as-folder modes (called \"bogus folder\" in the code):**\n\n- one click to turn this tag into an \"open folder\". It will appear as a virtual entry in the card list; clicking into it will only show cards with that tag\n- another click to turn this tag into a \"closed folder\". As above, but cards tagged with this tag will not appear by default - you'll need to click into the folder to see them.\n- another click to reset tag-as-folder state for this tag."

This gives you insight into the AI's \"thought process\" and shows other directions the response could have taken. Looking at these alternatives can help you understand whether there were several likely options or a single clear choice.\n\n{ width=500}\n\nIf you see a token that you think the AI should have chosen differently, choose an alternative and the message will regenerate from that point forward, potentially giving you a different response.\n\n### Rerolling\n\nIf you change a specific token and regenerate the response, the part of the new response before the changed token will be the same as the original response. This part is shown in gray.

    "content": "# Common Settings\n\nThese settings control the sampling process when generating text using a language model. The meaning of these settings is universal for all the supported backends.\n\n## Context Settings\n\n### Response (tokens)\n\nThe maximum number of tokens that the API will generate to respond.\n\n- The higher the response length, the longer it will take to generate the response.\n- If supported by the API, you can enable `Streaming` to display the response bit by bit as it is being generated.\n- When `Streaming` is off, responses will be displayed all at once when they are complete.\n\n### Context (tokens)\n\nThe maximum number of tokens that SillyTavern will send to the API as the prompt, minus the response length.\n\n- Context comprises character information, system prompts, chat history, etc.\n- A dotted line between messages denotes the context range for the chat. Messages above that line are not sent to the AI.\n- To see a composition of the context after generating the message, click on the `Prompt Itemization` message option (expand the `...` menu and click on the lined square icon).\n\n## Sampler Parameters\n\n### Temperature\n\nTemperature controls the randomness in token selection:\n\n- Low temperature (<1.0) leads to more predictable text, favoring higher probability tokens\n- High temperature (>1.0) increases creativity and diversity in the output by giving lower probability tokens a better chance.\n\nSet to 1 for the original probabilities.\n\n### Repetition Penalty\n\nAttempts to curb repetition by penalizing tokens based on how often they occur in the context.\n\nSet the value to 1 to disable its effect.\n\n#### Repetition Penalty Range\n\nHow many tokens from the last generated token will be considered for the repetition penalty. This can break responses if set too high, as common words like \"the, a, and,\" etc. will be penalized the most.\n\nSet the value to 0 to disable its effect.\n\n#### Repetition Penalty Slope\n\nIf both this and `Repetition Penalty Range` are above 0, the repetition penalty will have a greater effect at the end of the prompt. The higher the value, the stronger the effect.\n\nSet the value to 0 to disable its effect.\n\n### Top K\n\nTop K sets a maximum amount of top tokens that can be chosen from. For example, if Top K is 20, this means only the 20 highest ranking tokens will be kept (regardless of their probabilities being diverse or limited).\n\nSet to 0 (or -1, depending on your backend) to disable.\n\n### Top P\n\nTop P (a.k.a. nucleus sampling) adds up all the top tokens required to add up to the target percentage. If the Top 2 tokens are both 25%, and Top P is 0.50, only the Top 2 tokens are considered.\n\nSet the value to 1 to disable its effect.\n\n### Typical P\n\nTypical P Sampling prioritizes tokens based on their deviation from the average entropy of the set. It maintains tokens whose cumulative probability is close to a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.5), emphasizing those with average information content.\n\nSet the value to 1 to disable its effect.\n\n### Min P\n\nLimits the token pool by cutting off low-probability tokens relative to the top token. Produces more coherent responses but can also worsen repetition if set too high.\n\n- Works best at low values such as `0.1-0.01`, but can be set higher with a high `Temperature`. For example: `Temperature: 5, Min P: 0.5`\n\nSet the value to 0 to disable its effect.\n\n### Top A\n\nTop A sets a threshold for token selection based on the square of the highest token probability. For example, if the Top-A value is 0.2 and the top token's probability is 50%, tokens with probabilities below 5% (0.2 * 0.5^2) are excluded.\n\nSet the value to 0 to disable its effect.\n\n### Tail Free Sampling\n\nTail-Free Sampling (TFS) searches for a tail of low-probability tokens in the distribution, by analyzing the rate of change in token probabilities using derivatives. It retains tokens up to a threshold (e.g., 0.3) based on the normalized second derivative. The closer to 0, the more discarded tokens.\n\nSet the value to 1 to disable its effect.\n\n### Smoothing Factor\n\nIncreases the likelihood of high-probability tokens while decreasing the likelihood of low-probability tokens using a quadratic transformation. Aims to produce more creative responses regardless of `Temperature`.\n\n- Works best without truncation samplers such as `Top K`, `Top P`, `Min P`, etc.\n\nSet the value to 0 to disable its effect.\n\n### Dynamic Temperature\n\nScales temperature dynamically based on the likelihood of the top token. Aims to produce more creative outputs without sacrificing coherency.\n\n- Accepts a temperature range from minimum to maximum. For example: `Minimum Temp: 0.75` and `Minimum Temp: 1.25`\n- `Exponent` applies an exponential curve based on the top token.\n\nUntick to disable its effect.\n\n### Epsilon Cutoff\n\nEpsilon cutoff sets a probability floor below which tokens are excluded from being sampled. In units of 1e-4; a reasonable value is 3.\n\nSet to 0 to disable.\n\n### Eta Cutoff\n\nEta cutoff is the main parameter of the special Eta Sampling technique. In units of 1e-4; a reasonable value is 3. See the paper Truncation Sampling as Language Model Desmoothing by Hewitt et al. (2022) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15191) for details.\n\nSet to 0 to disable.\n\n### DRY Repetition Penalty\n\nDRY penalizes tokens that would extend the end of the input into a sequence that has previously occurred in the input. If you want to allow repeating certain sequences verbatim (e.g. names), you can add them to the sequence breakers list. See the Pull Request here (https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/pull/5677).\n\nSet multiplier to 0 to disable.\n\n### Exclude Top Choices (XTC)\n\nXTC sampling algorithm removes the most likely tokens from consideration instead of pruning the least likely tokens It removes all except the least likely token meeting a given threshold, with a given probability. This ensures that at least one \"viable\" choice remains, retaining coherence. See the Pull Request here (https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/pull/6335).\n\nSet probability to 0 to disable.\n\n### Mirostat\n\nMirostat matches the output perplexity to that of the input, thus avoiding the repetition trap (where, as the autoregressive inference produces text, the perplexity of the output tends toward zero) and the confusion trap (where the perplexity diverges). For details, see the paper Mirostat: A Neural Text Decoding Algorithm that Directly Controls Perplexity by Basu et al. (2020) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14966).\n\nMode chooses the Mirostat version.\n\n- 0 = disable,\n- 1 = Mirostat 1.0 (llama.cpp only),\n- 2 = Mirostat 2.0.\n\n### Beam Search\n\nA greedy, brute-force algorithm used in LLM sampling to find the most likely sequence of words or tokens. It expands multiple candidate sequences at once, maintaining a fixed number (beam width) of top sequences at each step.\n\n### Top nsigma\n\nA sampling method that filters logits based on their statistical properties. It keeps tokens within n standard deviations of the maximum logit value, providing a simpler alternative to top-p/top-k sampling while maintaining sampling stability across different temperatures."

    "content": "# FAQ\n\n## Explain what SillyTavern is about\n\nModern AI language models such as ChatGPT have gotten so powerful that some of them are now convincingly able to simulate a character you create, and who you can chat with, write fiction with, etc. For example, you can tell the AI to pretend to be a Go instructor named Jubei from medieval Japan, and it will act and respond accordingly. You can have a long chat with Jubei, go to the pub together, decide to get in a fight with samurais, whatever you can imagine, and the AI will play along and write/react around this content, acting as your foil and dungeon master. Your imagination is the limit. You can tell the AI to pretend it's Wonder Woman. You can also specify a scenario (\"Wonder Woman and I are robbing a bank\"), a writing style (\"Wonder Woman speaks in ebonics\"), or anything else you can think of.\n\nSillyTavern is an app to facilitate these uses:\n\n* It's a user interface that handles communication with AI language models.\n* It lets you create new character cards (prompts), and switch between them easily.\n* It lets you import characters created by other people.\n* It will keep your chat history with a character, allowing you to resume at any time, start a new chat, review old chats, etc.\n* In the background, it does the necessary things to prepare the AI prompt for you. Specifically, it will send a system prompt (instructions for the AI) that primes the AI to follow certain rules to improve response accuracy.\n\n## Give me an overview of my AI model options\n\nSillyTavern can interact with two types of AI:\n\n1. [Web services](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_openai.md) (Cloud-based, usually paid, proprietary, closed)\n2. [Self-hosted](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_self-hosted.md) (local, free, open-source)\n\n### Paid web service AIs\n\nPaid web models are black boxes. You pay a company to use their AI service. You put your account info in SillyTavern and it will connect to your provider to use the AI on your behalf.\n\nPros:\n\n* Really easy to get started.\n* Highest quality AI writing.\n\nCons:\n\n* They cost money to use.\n* Everything is logged on their server. Privacy concerns.\n* They are often censored and will refuse to chat with you about certain subjects.\n\n### Self-hosted AIs\n\nSelf-hosted models are free models you can run on your PC but require a powerful PC and more work to set up.\n\nPros:\n\n* Once you set them up, they can be used for free even without Internet access.\n* Total privacy. Everything you write stays on your own PC.\n* There's a wide variety of models. As a community-driven technology, you can find models that fit certain tasks or behaviors that you want.\n\nCons:\n\n* They are not as capable as <abbr title=\"State of the art\">SOTA</abbr> models (i.e., they write worse dialog, are less creative, etc).\n* Running local models requires a GPU with at least 6GB VRAM.\n\nIf you are interested in using these, refer to the dedicated guide here: [How To Use A Self-Hosted Model](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_self-hosted.md).\n\n## Can I use SillyTavern on my phone or tablet?\n\niPhones and iPads are not capable of running the whole SillyTavern app, but since it's just a web interface, you can run it on another computer on your home Wi-Fi, and then access it in your mobile browser. Refer to [Remote Connections](SillyTavern_Administration_remote-connections.md) for more information.\n\nFor Android users, in addition to the above, you can run the whole SillyTavern directly on your phone, without needing a PC, using the Termux app. Refer to [Installation (Android)](SillyTavern_Installation_Android.md). (NOTE: Termux installations are not officially supported, and we can't guarantee it will work.)\n\n## I tried to import a PNG character card but got an error that it's invalid. Why?\n\nTwo possibilities:\n\n1. The card did not have the definitions embedded inside it and was just a normal image file. Some programs or file managers will strip the embedded definitions from the card when you save them. Make sure you're using the raw PNG file as it was posted by the person who shared it.\n2. The PNG file was actually a WEBP file with a `.png` filename. You can try renaming the card to `.webp` before importing, or look for a proper PNG version of the image.\n\n## How can I make my own AI character?\n\n1. Click the Character Management button\n2. Click Create New Character\n3. Under Character Name, give a name, like Amanda\n4. Optionally, click the Select Avatar button to pick an image portrait for this character\n5. Under Description, describe the character, and include any information you want that you feel is relevant to the chat. For example: ```Amanda is a student traveling during her gap year. She's 6 feet tall, and a volleyball player. She has an athletic figure. She has long brown hair. She loves the Victorian England period, and watching TV and reading novels relating to that period.```\nFor example, if you want Amanda to be friendly, then you would add: ```Amanda is extremely cheerful and outgoing.```\n6. Under First Message, write the greeting the character when you begin a new chat. For example: ```*Amanda waves at you* Hey! Are you a backpacker too?```\n7. Click the Create Character button\n\nYou now have a basic character you can chat with. Select Amanda from the character list, and a new chat will begin.\n\nNote that you can use the Description and/or First Message to create a more specific scenario, and/or include yourself in the description. For example:\n\n```txt\nDescription:\nAmanda is a student traveling during her gap year. She's 6 feet tall, and a volleyball player. She has an athletic figure. She has long brown hair. She loves the Victorian England period, and watching TV and reading novels relating to that period. She's been keeping a secret that weighs heavily on her soul. She's waiting for the right person to unburden herself to, but this may lead to a cat and mouse game against a powerful secret society. She's recently arrived in Calcutta.\n\nYou're Rajesh Nahasmapetilon, a world-famous Indian volleyball superstar. You're out for a walk in Calcutta. Amanda spots you and screams in excitement.\n\nFirst Message:\n*Amanda runs up to you, beaming.* Rajesh! I can't believe it! I'm such a big fan. I have your poster in my bedroom.\n```\n\nAny relevant information you include can be used. How well it's used depends on the power level of the AI model.\n\nNOTE: you can go back and edit any of this information once the character is created, except the name.\n\n## Where are my API keys stored? Why can't I see them?\n\nSillyTavern saves your API keys to a `secrets.json` file in the user data directory (`/data/default-user/secrets.json` is the default path).\n\nBy default, API keys will not be visible from the interface after you have saved them and refreshed the page.\n\nIn order to enable viewing your keys:\n\n1. Set the value of `allowKeysExposure` to `true` in `config.yaml` file.\n2. Restart the SillyTavern server.\n3. Click the 'View hidden API keys' link at the bottom right of the API Connection Panel.\n\n## Performance Tips\n\n### Why is the UI so slow/jittery?\n\n* Try enabling the No Blur Effect (Fast UI) mode on the User settings panel.\n* Enable Reduced motion in the UI theme settings to remove cosmetic animations.\n* Make sure your browser is using Hardware Acceleration.\n* If using response streaming, set the streaming FPS to a lower value (10-15 FPS is recommended).\n\n### I'm experiencing an input lag. What can I do?\n\nPerformance degradation, particularly input lag, is most commonly attributed to browser extensions. Known problematic extensions include:\n\n* iCloud Password Manager\n* DeepL Translation\n* AI-based grammar correction tools\n* Various ad-blocking extensions\n\nIf you experience performance issues and cannot identify the cause, or suspect an issue with SillyTavern itself, please:\n\n1. Record a performance profile (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance/reference)\n2. Export the profile as a JSON file\n3. Submit it to the development team for analysis\n\nWe recommend first testing with all browser extensions and third-party SillyTavern extensions disabled to isolate the source of the performance degradation.\n\n### When I import a lot of characters, the app becomes slow. Why?\n\nUnfortunately, SillyTavern wasn't designed to handle huge character libraries. The more you have, the longer it will take to load the character list. Evidential data suggests that the performance degradation starts to become noticeable when you have more than 1000 characters.\n\nHowever, there are some things you can do to mitigate the issue:\n\n**1. Use lazy loading.**\n\nEnable lazy loading of characters setting the value `performance.lazyLoadCharacters` to true in the `config.yaml` file. After the next server restart, the character list will only load the full data of characters you interact with. Please be aware that some third-party extensions may not work correctly with this setting enabled if they were not updated to support it (contact the extension developer for more information).\n\n**2. Use memory cache.**\n\nIncrease the memory cache capacity if you have some spare RAM. This will allow the server to keep more characters in memory, reducing the time it takes to load them. You can do this by adjusting the value of `performance.memoryCacheCapacity` to a higher number in the `config.yaml` file. The default value is `100mb`. Approximate rule of thumb: increase the value by 100mb for every 3000 characters you have.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. Advanced (fuzzy) characters search will not work with lazy loading enabled. Only character names will be searched.\n2. Memory cache is disabled on Android devices due to the limited amount of available memory.\n\n## How to make the AI write more?\n\nSometimes the AI will only respond with a single sentence when you'd like it to be more verbose.\nThis is usually a problem with locally run models.\n\nIf you simply want the bot to continue writing from where it left off at the end of its most recent reply, you can send an empty user message by typing nothing into the Input Bar and clicking Send. This will force the bot to continue the story.\n\nStrategies for fixing this:\n\n* Increase the value of the `Response Length` setting\n* Design a good `First Message` for the Character, which shows them speaking in a long-winded manner. AI models can improve a lot when given guidance about the writing style you expect.\n* Add a phrase in the character's Description Box such as \"likes to talk a lot\" or \"very verbose speaker\"\n* Do the same thing for your `Author's Note`, or `Post-History Instruction Prompt`\n* As a last resort, you can try turning on `Auto-Continue` (in the User Settings panel), but will make responses come out slower because it's making the AI produce small replies back to back, and then combining them all together into one big reply. It may also be incompatible with some API options.\n\n## How to make the AI write less?\n\nThis is mostly only a problem for models like ChatGPT or Claude. The same strategies can be applied but in reverse.\n\n* Decrease the value of the `Response Length` setting\n* Give the character a phrase like 'short spoken', or 'doesn't talk much' line in their Description.\n* Give the character a brief First Message to set the tone and expectation for the chat.\n* Make sure `Auto-Continue` is turned off.\n\n## How to make the AI stop writing the actions of my character, and driving the plot all on its own?\n\nThis should be handled in the `Author's Note` with a combination of phrases like:\n\n* \\{\\{char\\}\\}'s responses shall only be passive and reactive to \\{\\{user\\}\\}'s actions.\n* Your next response shall be solely from the POV of \\{\\{char\\}\\}.\n* You are never allowed to dictate actions or speech for \\{\\{user\\}\\}"

They are used throughout SillyTavern in prompts, character cards, lorebooks, Quick Replies, and more.**\n\n## Finding Available Macros\n\nSillyTavern provides built-in documentation for all available macros:\n\n- **Slash command**: Type `/? macros` in the chat input to display a list of all registered macros with their descriptions.\n- **Autocomplete**: See [Macro Autocomplete](SillyTavern_Usage.md) below for details on getting suggestions while typing.\n\n### Macro Autocomplete\n\nMacro autocomplete provides suggestions for available macros as you type. It works in all text fields that support macros throughout SillyTavern.\n\nType `{{` to start autocomplete for macros, showing available macros and their arguments, potential [Macro Flags](SillyTavern_Usage.md), [Variable Shorthands](SillyTavern_Usage.md), and more.\n\n**Where autocomplete appears by default:**\n\n- Chat user input box\n- Expanded editor (full-screen text editing, opened via the 'Expand' button next to text fields)\n- Prompt manager editor\n\n**Triggering autocomplete in other fields:**\n\n- Press **Ctrl+Space** in any macro-supporting text field to open the autocomplete popup\n- Enable **Settings \u2192 AutoComplete Settings \u2192 Show in all macro fields** to have autocomplete appear automatically in all macro fields\n\n## Basic Syntax\n\nMacros are enclosed in double curly braces:\n\n```txt\n{{macroName}}\n```\n\nMacro names are **case-insensitive**. `{{User}}`, `{{USER}}`, and `{{user}}` all resolve to the same macro.\n\nExamples:\n\n```txt\n{{user}}        // Returns the current user/persona name\n{{char}}        // Returns the current character name\n{{time}}        // Returns the current time\n{{date}}        // Returns the current date\n```\n\n## Arguments\n\nMany macros accept arguments to customize their behavior.\n\n### Space Separator\n\nFor macros with a single argument, a space can separate the macro name from its argument:\n\n```txt\n{{macroName argument}}\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```txt\n{{getvar myVariable}}\n{{roll 1d20}}\n{{reverse Hello World}}\n```\n\n### Double Colon Separator\n\nUse `::` to separate multiple arguments:\n\n```txt\n{{macroName::arg1::arg2::arg3}}\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```txt\n{{setvar::myVariable::Hello World}}\n{{random::red::green::blue}}\n{{roll::2d6+3}}\n```\n\nBoth space and `::` are the recommended syntax for macro arguments.\n\n### Single Colon Separator (Legacy)\n\nA single `:` can also introduce arguments, but this syntax is considered legacy and not recommended for new content:\n\n```txt\n{{macroName:argument}}\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```txt\n{{roll:1d20}}\n```\n\n## Whitespace in Macro Definitions\n\nWhitespace between the macro name, separators, and arguments is ignored. This allows for more readable formatting:\n\n```txt\n{{ macroName :: arg1 :: arg2 }}\n{{ setvar :: myVariable :: some value }}\n{{ if :: condition }}\n```\n\nAll of the above are equivalent to their compact forms without extra spaces.\n\n## Nested Macros\n\nMacros can be nested inside other macros. Inner macros are resolved first:\n\n```txt\n{{getvar::{{char}}_mood}}\n```\n\nThis first resolves `{{char}}` (e.g., to \"Alice\"), then resolves `{{getvar::Alice_mood}}`.\n\nMore examples:\n\n```txt\n{{setvar::greeting::Hello, {{user}}!}}\n```\n\nSets a variable with content that includes the user's name.\n\n```txt\n{{if {{getvar::showDetails}}}}Details here{{/if}}\n```\n\nThe condition itself is a macro that retrieves a variable value.\n\n## Scoped Macros\n\n**Staging Feature**\n\nThis is currently only available on the `staging` branch of SillyTavern, and not part of the latest release.\n\n**Any macro that accepts at least one argument supports scoped syntax. The content between opening and closing tags becomes the **last argument** of the macro.**\n\n### Scoped Syntax\n\nInstead of writing the last argument inline, it can be placed between opening and closing tags:\n\n```txt\n{{macroName argument}}\n  scoped content here\n{{/macroName}}\n```\n\nThe closing tag uses the `/` flag before the macro name: `{{/macroName}}`.\n\nThis is equivalent to writing:\n\n```txt\n{{macroName::argument::scoped content here}}\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nSetting a variable with multiline content:\n\n```txt\n{{ setvar backstory }}\n  This character was born in a small village\n  and grew up to become a renowned scholar.\n{{ /setvar }}\n```\n\nUsing `reverse` with scoped content:\n\n```txt\n{{ reverse }}\n  Hello World\n{{ /reverse }}\n```\n\nThis returns \"dlroW olleH\".\n\n### Content Trimming\n\nBy default, scoped content is automatically trimmed:\n\n- Leading and trailing whitespace is removed\n- Consistent indentation is de-dented (the indentation of the first non-empty line is removed from all lines)\n\nThis allows clean formatting:\n\n```txt\n{{ if condition }}\n    # Heading\n    Some content here\n{{ /if }}\n```\n\nProduces `# Heading\\nSome content here` (without the leading spaces).\n\nTo preserve all whitespace including leading/trailing newlines, use the `#` flag. See [Macro Flags](SillyTavern_Usage.md) for details.\n\n## Conditional Macros\n\n**Staging Feature**\n\nThis is currently only available on the `staging` branch of SillyTavern, and not part of the latest release.\n\n**The `{{if}}` macro renders content conditionally based on whether a value is truthy or falsy.**\n\n### Simple Condition\n\n```txt\n{{ if description }}\n  # Character Description\n  {{ description }}\n{{ /if }}\n```\n\nThis displays the heading and description only if `description` returns a non-empty value.\n\nThe condition can be:\n\n- A macro name (resolved automatically if no arguments are required)\n- Any value from a nested macro like `{{getvar::flag}}`\n- A variable shorthand like `.myFlag` or `$globalFlag` (see [Variable Shorthands](SillyTavern_Usage.md))\n- Any text you want (that will implicitly resolve to truthy or falsy based on its content)\n\nFalsy values: empty string, `false`, `0`, `off`, `no`.\n\n### Using Variable Shorthands in Conditions\n\nVariable shorthands provide a concise way to check variable values in conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{ if .isEnabled }}\n  Feature is enabled.\n{{ /if }}\n\n{{ if !$globalDisabled }}\n  Not globally disabled.\n{{ /if }}\n```\n\nSee [Variable Shorthands](SillyTavern_Usage.md) for more details on shorthand notation.\n\n### Inverted Condition\n\nPrefix the condition with `!` to invert it:\n\n```txt\n{{ if !personality }}\n  No personality defined for this character.\n{{ /if }}\n```\n\n### If/Else Branches\n\nUse `{{else}}` inside an `{{if}}` block to define an alternative branch:\n\n```txt\n{{ if personality }}\n  {{ personality }}\n{{ else }}\n  No personality defined.\n{{ /if }}\n```\n\nAnother example:\n\n```txt\n{{ if {{getvar::details-block}} }}\n  # Details Block\n  {{ getvar::details-block }}\n{{ else }}\n  No details currently exist.\n{{ /if }}\n```\n\n## Macro Flags\n\n**Staging Feature**\n\nThis is currently only available on the `staging` branch of SillyTavern, and not part of the latest release.\n\n**Flags are special symbol characters placed between the opening braces and the macro name that modify macro behavior.**\n\n### Syntax\n\n```txt\n{{!macroName}}\n{{#macroName}}\n```\n\nFlags can be combined:\n\n```txt\n{{!?macroName}}\n```\n\nWhitespace is allowed between flags and the macro name:\n\n```txt\n{{ / macroName }}\n{{ # macroName }}\n```\n\n### Implemented Flags\n\n| Flag | Name | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `/` | Closing Block | Marks a closing tag for scoped macros. Example: `{{/if}}` |\n| `#` | Preserve Whitespace | Prevents automatic trimming of scoped content. |\n\n### Planned Flags (Not Yet Implemented)\n\n| Flag | Name | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `!` | Immediate | Resolve this macro before other macros in the same text. |\n| `?` | Delayed | Resolve this macro after other macros in the same text. |\n| `~` | Re-evaluate | Mark this macro for re-evaluation. |\n| `>` | Filter | Enable pipe-based output filters for this macro. |\n\n### Flags-like prefix operators\n\nVariable shorthand syntax uses prefix operators (`.` and `$`) which behave similarly to flags but are not flags themselves.  \nSee the [Variable Shorthands](SillyTavern_Usage.md) section for details.\n\n### Preserve Whitespace Flag\n\nUse the `#` flag when you need to preserve all whitespace in scoped content, including leading/trailing newlines and indentation:\n\n```txt\n{{ # setvar code }}\n    function hello() {\n        return \"world\";\n    }\n{{ /setvar }}\n```\n\nWithout `#`, the content would be trimmed and dedented. With `#`, all whitespace is preserved exactly as written\u2014including the newline after the opening tag and before the closing tag.\n\n## Comments\n\nUse the comment macro to add notes that won't appear in the output:\n\n```txt\n{{// This is a comment and will be removed}}\n```\n\nFor multi-line comments, use scoped syntax:\n\n```txt\n{{ // }}\n  This entire block is a comment.\n  It can span multiple lines.\n{{ /// }}\n```\n\n## Escaping Macros\n\nTo display literal curly braces without macro resolution, escape them with backslashes:\n\n```txt\n\\{\\{notAMacro\\}\\}\n```\n\nThis outputs `{{notAMacro}}` as plain text.\n\n## Variable Shorthands\n\n**Staging Feature**\n\nThis is currently only available on the `staging` branch of SillyTavern, and not part of the latest release.\n\n**Variable shorthands provide a concise syntax for common variable operations. Use `.` for local variables and `$` for global variables.**\n\n### Variable Shorthands Prefixes\n\n| Prefix | Name            | Description                                                     |\n| ------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `.`    | Local Variable  | Shorthand for local variable operations. Example: `{{.myvar}}`  |\n| `$`    | Global Variable | Shorthand for global variable operations. Example: `{{$myvar}}` |\n\nThese prefix operators have to be placed **immediately before** the variable name, after any optionally appearing [Macro Flags](SillyTavern_Usage.md). They aren't considered macro flags, but more indicators that a variable shorthand is being inserted, instead of a macro by name. The prefix operators are not part of the variable name itself, but rather modifiers that change how the variable is accessed.\n\n### Variable Names\n\nVariable names follow the same rules as macro identifiers: start with a letter, followed by letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens. The last character is not allowed to be an underscore or hyphen.\n\n```txt\n{{.my-var}}       // Valid\n{{.my_var}}       // Valid\n{{.myVar123}}     // Valid\n```\n\nIf your variable has an identifier that does not match the standard rules, you have to use the full variable macro syntax (e.g. `{{getvar::my\u00a7var----}}`), or rename/move your variable value.\n\n### Nested Macros in Values\n\nVariable values can contain nested macros:\n\n```txt\n{{.greeting = Hello, {{user}}!}}\n```\n\nResolves to a variable that saves `Hello, User!` inside. (If `{{user}}` is named \"User\")\n\n### Whitespace Handling\n\nWhitespace around operators is allowed:\n\n```txt\n{{ .myvar = spaced value }}\n{{ .counter ++ }}\n```\n\n### Variable Shorthand Operators\n\nThe following operators can be used with variable shorthands. Each operator follows the pattern `{{.varName operator value}}` or `{{$varName operator value}}`.\n\n| Operator | Name                      | Example                | Description                                            |\n| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| *(none)* | [Get](SillyTavern_Usage.md)      | `{{.myvar}}`           | Returns the variable value                             |\n| `=`      | [Set](SillyTavern_Usage.md)      | `{{.myvar = value}}`   | Sets the variable to a value, returns nothing         |\n| `++`     | [Increment](SillyTavern_Usage.md)   | `{{.counter++}}`       | Increments by 1, returns new value                     |\n| `--`     | [Decrement](SillyTavern_Usage.md)   | `{{.counter--}}`       | Decrements by 1, returns new value                     |\n| `+=`     | [Add](SillyTavern_Usage.md)               | `{{.score += 10}}`     | Adds to variable (numeric or string concatenation), returns nothing |\n| `-=`     | [Subtract](SillyTavern_Usage.md)     | `{{.health -= 5}}`     | Subtracts from variable (numeric only), returns nothing |\n| `||`   | [Logical Or](SillyTavern_Usage.md) | `{{.name || Guest}}` | Returns fallback if variable is falsy                  |\n| `??`     | [Nullish Coalescing](SillyTavern_Usage.md) | `{{.name ??

Returns an empty string.\n\n#### Increment\n\nUse `++` to increment a numeric variable by 1:\n\n```txt\n{{.counter++}}    // Increment local variable, returns new value\n{{$counter++}}    // Increment global variable, returns new value\n```\n\nEquivalent to `{{incvar counter}}` and `{{incglobalvar counter}}`. Returns the new value after incrementing.\n\n#### Decrement\n\nUse `--` to decrement a numeric variable by 1:\n\n```txt\n{{.counter--}}    // Decrement local variable, returns new value\n{{$counter--}}    // Decrement global variable, returns new value\n```\n\nEquivalent to `{{decvar counter}}` and `{{decglobalvar counter}}`. Returns the new value after decrementing.\n\n#### Add\n\nUse `+=` to add a numeric value to a variable:\n\n```txt\n{{.score += 10}}     // Add 10 to local variable\n{{$total += 5}}      // Add 5 to global variable\n```\n\nEquivalent to `{{addvar::score::10}}` and `{{addglobalvar::total::5}}`. Returns an empty string.\n\nThe add operator also supports appending strings to an existing string variable, if neither of them are numbers:\n\n```txt\n{{.myvar += {{noop}} | Second block}}   // Resolves to \"Content | Second block\" when the variable before was \"Content\".\n                                        // Use `{{noop}}` to be able to add whitespaces, that otherwise would be trimmed automatically.\n```\n\n#### Subtract\n\nUse `-=` to subtract a numeric value from a variable:\n\n```txt\n{{.health -= 10}}    // Subtract 10 from local variable\n{{$points -= 5}}     // Subtract 5 from global variable\n```\n\nEquivalent to `{{addvar::score::10}}` and `{{addglobalvar::total::5}}`, but with a negative/inverted number. Returns an empty string.\nIf the value is not a valid number, a warning is logged and the variable is unchanged.\n\n#### Logical Or\n\nUse `||` to provide a fallback value when the variable is falsy (empty string, `0`, `false`):\n\n```txt\n{{.name || Anonymous}}     // Returns \"Anonymous\" if .name is empty or falsy\n{{$setting || default}}    // Returns \"default\" if $setting is falsy\n```\n\nReturns the variable value if truthy, otherwise returns the fallback value. The fallback is **only evaluated if needed** (lazy evaluation).\n\n#### Nullish Coalescing\n\nUse `??` to provide a fallback value only when the variable does not exist:\n\n```txt\n{{.name ?? Guest}}         // Returns \"Guest\" only if .name is not defined\n{{$config ?? default}}     // Returns \"default\" only if $config doesn't exist\n```\n\nUnlike `||`, this returns the variable value even if it's falsy (empty string, `0`, `false`) \u2014 as long as the variable exists. The fallback is **only evaluated if needed** (lazy evaluation).\n\n#### Logical Or Assign\n\nUse `||=` to set a variable to a value only if it's currently falsy:\n\n```txt\n{{.name ||= Anonymous}}    // Sets and returns \"Anonymous\" if .name is falsy\n{{$count ||= 0}}           // Sets and returns \"0\" if $count is falsy\n```\n\nIf the variable is already truthy, returns the current value without modification. Returns the final value (either existing or newly set).\n\n#### Nullish Coalescing Assign\n\nUse `??=` to set a variable to a value only if it doesn't exist:\n\n```txt\n{{.name ??= Guest}}        // Sets and returns \"Guest\" only if .name is undefined\n{{$config ??= default}}    // Sets and returns \"default\" only if $config doesn't exist\n```\n\nUnlike `||=`, this preserves falsy values (empty string, `0`, `false`) if the variable already exists. Returns the final value (either existing or newly set).\n\n#### Equals\n\nUse `==` to compare a variable value to another value:\n\n```txt\n{{.status == active}}      // Returns \"true\" if .status equals \"active\", otherwise \"false\"\n{{$mode == dark}}          // Returns \"true\" if $mode equals \"dark\", otherwise \"false\"\n```\n\nPerforms a string comparison and returns the literal string `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.  \nTreats not existing variables, null variables and empty variables as the same.\n\nUseful in `{{if}}` conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{if {{.status == active}} }}Active mode{{/if}}\n```\n\n#### Not Equals\n\nUse `!=` to compare a variable value to another value for inequality:\n\n```txt\n{{.status != inactive}}    // Returns \"true\" if .status is NOT \"inactive\", otherwise \"false\"\n{{$mode != light}}         // Returns \"true\" if $mode is NOT \"light\", otherwise \"false\"\n```\n\nPerforms a string comparison and returns `\"true\"` if the values are different, `\"false\"` if they are equal.  \nTreats not existing variables, null variables and empty variables as the same.\n\nUseful in `{{if}}` conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{if {{.status != disabled}} }}Feature enabled{{/if}}\n```\n\n#### Greater Than\n\nUse `>` to check if a variable's numeric value is greater than another value:\n\n```txt\n{{.score > 50}}        // Returns \"true\" if .score is greater than 50\n{{$level > 5}}         // Returns \"true\" if $level is greater than 5\n```\n\nPerforms a numeric comparison and returns the literal string `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.\n\nUseful in `{{if}}` conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{if {{.score > 100}} }}High score!{{/if}}\n```\n\n#### Greater Than or Equal\n\nUse `>=` to check if a variable's numeric value is greater than or equal to another value:\n\n```txt\n{{.level >= 10}}       // Returns \"true\" if .level is at least 10\n{{$points >= 100}}     // Returns \"true\" if $points is 100 or more\n```\n\nPerforms a numeric comparison and returns the literal string `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.\n\nUseful in `{{if}}` conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{if {{$level >= 10}} }}Unlocked advanced features{{/if}}\n```\n\n#### Less Than\n\nUse `<` to check if a variable's numeric value is less than another value:\n\n```txt\n{{.health < 20}}       // Returns \"true\" if .health is below 20\n{{$timer < 0}}         // Returns \"true\" if $timer is negative\n```\n\nPerforms a numeric comparison and returns the literal string `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.\n\nUseful in `{{if}}` conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{if {{.health < 20}} }}Low health warning!{{/if}}\n```\n\n#### Less Than or Equal\n\nUse `<=` to check if a variable's numeric value is less than or equal to another value:\n\n```txt\n{{.health <= 0}}       // Returns \"true\" if .health is 0 or below\n{{$attempts <= 3}}     // Returns \"true\" if $attempts is 3 or fewer\n```\n\nPerforms a numeric comparison and returns the literal string `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.\n\nUseful in `{{if}}` conditions:\n\n```txt\n{{if {{.health <= 0}} }}Game over{{/if}}\n```\n\n## Legacy Syntax\n\nFor backwards compatibility, angle bracket markers are still supported:\n\n| Legacy | Equivalent Macro |\n|--------|------------------|\n| `<USER>` | `{{user}}` |\n| `<BOT>` | `{{char}}` |\n| `<CHAR>` | `{{char}}` |\n| `<GROUP>` | `{{group}}` |\n| `<CHARIFNOTGROUP>` | `{{charIfNotGroup}}` |\n\nThese are automatically converted to their macro equivalents during processing.\n\n> **Note:** Legacy syntax is not recommended. Use the equivalent `{{macro}}` syntax instead for new content.\n\n## Common Macros by Category\n\nUse `/? macros` for the complete list of available macros and their detailed descriptions.\n\n**###

    "content": "# Personas\n\n## What is a Persona?\n\nA persona in SillyTavern is the identity you use to participate in chats \u2014 essentially a combination of your display name, avatar, and optional descriptive text. Personas allow you to easily switch roles or \"characters\" you speak as, without having to manually update your username/avatar each time.\n\n****Note:** Legacy user avatars/names that weren't tied to a persona have been removed. Existing data will be migrated to personas. If no name was specified, the persona will be named \"[Unnamed Persona]\".**\n\n**## How to Create a Persona?**\n\n1. Open the **Persona Management** panel (<i class=\"fa-solid fa-face-smile\"></i> button in the top menu).\n2. Create a blank persona with the **Create** button and give it a name.\n3. In the persona list, select the newly created persona.\n4. On the right side, you can fill in your description and set an avatar via the \"Change Persona Image\" button. Both are optional.\n5. Now your persona is ready to use in chats.\n\n### Convert Character to Persona\n\nPersonas can also be created by converting any existing character. Simply open the character, select \"More...\" and click \"Convert to Persona\". A persona with the same name and description will be created. Other character card fields like Scenario or Personality will not be used. The character will not be deleted.\n\nSince `{{user}}` and `{{char}}` macros have opposite meanings when used in Persona and Character descriptions, you'll be prompted to swap them if the converted description contains either of them.\n\n**## Persona Description**\n\nEach persona can store a custom text description \u2014 mental and physical traits, age, occupation, or any personal details. These can also include template macros such as `{{char}}` or `{{user}}` (see [Macros](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_macros.md)).\n\nWhere your persona description is injected into the AI prompt depends on the **Position** setting in the Persona Management panel:\n\n- **None (disabled)**\n- **In Story String / Prompt Manager** (the default)\n- **Top of Author's Note** / **Bottom of Author's Note** (will only be added when an Author's Note exists)\n- **In Chat @ Depth** (this will open up configuration options to set depth and the role)\n\nThe position is saved **per persona**.\n\n## Persona Title\n\nThe title is an optional text field that can be used to store additional information about the persona and is not used in the prompt, but displayed in the Persona Management panel.\n\nTo set a title, click the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-pencil\"></i> Rename Persona** button in the Persona Management panel and enter the title in the \"Persona Title\" field, or specify it during persona creation. Setting an empty value when the title already exists will remove it.\n\n## Persona Connections / Locking\n\nPersona connections ensure that a given persona is automatically selected in certain situations. If no persona is connected, the currently chosen persona will stay selected.\n\nThere are three types of locking:\n\n1. **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-unlock\"></i> Chat lock** \u2013 The persona is locked to the current chat.\n2. **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-unlock\"></i> Character lock** \u2013 The persona is locked to a specific character.\n3. **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-crown\"></i> Default persona** \u2013 One persona that is used whenever no other locks apply.\n\n### 1. Lock to a Chat\n\nIf a persona is locked to a chat, opening that chat in the future will automatically switch your active persona to the locked one.\n\n- **To lock**: Select the desired persona, then click the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-unlock\"></i> Chat** button under the \"Connections\" section (or use `/persona-lock type=chat on`).\n- **To unlock**: Click the button again (or use `/persona-lock type=chat off`).\n\n### 2. Lock to a Character\n\nYou can also link a persona to a specific character. Opening any chat with that character automatically selects your locked persona.\n\n- **To lock**: Select the desired persona, then click the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-unlock\"></i> Character** button under the \"Connections\" section (or use `/persona-lock type=character on`).\n- **To unlock**: Click the button again (or use `/persona-lock type=character off`).\n\nThe Persona Management panel also shows which characters are linked to that persona (displayed as small avatars). Clicking them navigates directly to that character's chat.\n\n#### Locking Multiple Personas to the Same Character\n\nIf another persona was already linked with that character, it will be automatically unlinked by default.\n\nTo have multiple personas linked at once, the global setting **Allow multiple persona connections per character** can be used.  \nIf multiple personas are linked to the same character, you'll see a popup asking which persona to use each time you open or start a new chat with that character (unless a persona is bound to the chat).\n\n### 3. Default Persona\n\nYour **default persona** is used whenever there's no other relevant lock. The default persona is recognizable by a yellow border around its avatar.\n\n- **To set/unset default**: Select the desired persona, then click the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-crown\"></i> Default** button under the \"Connections\" section (or use `/persona-lock type=default`).\n\nOnly one persona can be chosen as the default persona.\n\n### Temporary Persona\n\nIf any of the three connection options connects a persona to the current character/chat, you can still choose to use a different persona. This persona will be marked in the persona panel as \"Temporary Persona\". Any reload of the browser window or switch to a different chat and back will reset it to the linked persona again.\n\nYou can manually *convert* a Temporary Persona to be persistently connected by linking it to the chat.\n\n## Global Persona Settings\n\nAll settings under the **Current Persona** are saved per-persona. A few global settings exist too, those can be found under **Global Persona Settings** in the Persona Management panel.\n\n1. **Show notifications on switching personas**\n   - Enables persona-related toast messages (e.g., \"Persona Auto Selected\", \"Temporary Persona\").\n\n2. **Allow multiple persona connections per character**\n   - When **enabled**, you can link multiple personas to a single character. Opening that character's chat will prompt you which persona to use. If disabled, only one persona can be connected to a character at a time.\n\n3. **Auto-lock a chosen persona to the chat**\n   - When **enabled**, any time you select a persona (manually or by auto-selection) or create a new chat, it locks that persona to the chat.  \n   This combined with \"Allow multiple\" provides the option to have a persona selection per character, but keep it bound once chosen for a chat.\n\n## Slash Commands for Personas\n\n### `/persona-lock type=<type?>`\n\n- `chat` locks the current persona to your active chat.\n- `character` locks the current persona to the character in use.\n- `none` (or no argument) unlocks/clears the persona lock for the current context.\n- If used without arguments, it returns the current lock state (or an error if none is set).\n- The lock state can be chosen via `on`, `off` or `toggle`. Default is toggle.\n\n### `/persona <name>`\n\n- Quickly switch your active persona by name without opening the Persona Management panel.\n- Example: `/persona Blaze`.\n- Using `mode=temp` allows to temporarily set your name of the **current** persona, even though a persona with the same name might already exist (preserving your current avatar and description).\n\n### `/persona-sync`\n\n- Re-attributes all user messages in the active chat to the **current** persona and its name.\n\n> **Note:** The older `/lock` and `/unlock` commands remain for backward compatibility but may be removed in the future. Use `/persona-lock` instead.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Switching personas mid-chat** doesn't re-attribute your past user messages to the new persona; those remain attributed to whichever persona you were using at the time.\n2. **Batch re-attribution**: If you ever need all prior messages to match a new persona, hit the **sync** button or use `/persona-sync`.\n3. **Replace persona images** without losing description or locks by choosing your persona and clicking the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-images\"></i> Change Persona Image** button.\n4. **Character link popups**: If multiple personas are linked to the same character, you'll get a popup to pick which persona each time you open the chat. This is a handy way to have a small selection of personas to choose from for specific characters.\n5. **Backups**: You can back up your entire persona list (names, character connections, descriptions) with the **Backup** button in Persona Management, and restore it later if needed.\n\n**Backup Remarks**\n\n- Images and chat connections are not saved together with personas and will not be backed up via this.\n- These backups are not designed to be shared, as they contain internal links."

    "content": "# Advanced Formatting\n\nThe settings provided in this section allow for more control over the [prompt-building](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_index.md) strategy, primarily for Text Completion APIs.\n\nMost of the settings in this panel do not apply to Chat Completions APIs as they are governed by the prompt manager system instead.\n\n+++ Text Completion APIs\n* [System Prompt](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md)\n* [Context Template](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md)\n* [Tokenizer](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md)\n* [Custom Stopping Strings](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md)\n+++ Chat Completion APIs\n* System Prompt: not applicable, use [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md)\n* Context Template: not applicable, use [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md)\n* [Tokenizer](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md)\n* [Custom Stopping Strings](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md)\n+++\n\n## Resetting Templates\n\nYou can restore the default templates to their original state. This can be done either through the UI or by manually deleting the relevant data files.\n\n### UI Reset\n\n1. Open the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-font\"></i> Advanced Formatting** menu.\n2. Pick the template you want to reset.\n3. Click the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-recycle\"></i> Restore current template** button.\n4. Confirm the action when prompted.\n\n### Manual Reset\n\n**Make sure the `skipContentCheck` setting is set to `false` in [config.yaml](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md), otherwise the content check will not be triggered.**\n\n**1. Navigate to your user data directory (see [Data paths](SillyTavern_Installation_index.md) for details).**\n\n2. Delete the `content.log` file from the root of your user data directory. This file tracks the default files copied for your user.\n3. Delete the template JSON files from the relevant subdirectories (`context`, `instruct`, `sysprompt`, etc.).\n4. Restart the SillyTavern server. The application will repopulate the default content, restoring any deleted default templates.\n\n## Backend-defined templates\n\n**Applies to: Text Completion APIs**\n\nNot applicable to Chat Completion APIs as they use a different prompt builder.\n\n**Some Text Completion sources provide an ability to automatically choose templates recommended by the model author. This works by comparing a hash of the chat template defined in the model's `tokenizer_config.json` file with one of the default SillyTavern templates.**\n\n1. **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-bolt\"></i> Derive templates** option must be enabled in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-font\"></i> Advanced Formatting** menu. This can be applied to Context, Instruct, or both.\n2. A supported backend must be chosen as a Text Completion source. Currently only llama.cpp and KoboldCpp support deriving templates.\n3. The model must correctly report its metadata when the connection to the API is established. If this didn't work, try updating the backend to the latest version.\n4. The reported chat template hash must match the one of the known SillyTavern templates (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/public/scripts/chat-templates.js). This only covers default templates, such as Llama 3, Gemma 2, Mistral V7, etc.\n5. If the hash matches, the template will be automatically selected if it exists in the templates list (i.e., not renamed or deleted).\n\n## System Prompt\n\n**Applies to: Text Completion APIs**\n\nFor equivalent settings in Chat Completion APIs, use [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md). The **Main Prompt** is the equivalent of the System Prompt in Chat Completion APIs.\n\n**The System Prompt defines the general instructions for the model to follow. It sets the tone and context for the conversation. For example, it tells the model to act as an AI assistant, a writing partner, or a fictional character.**\n\nThe System Prompt is a part of the [Story String](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_context-template.md) and usually the first part of the prompt that the model receives.\n\nSee the [prompting guide](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_index.md) to learn more about the System Prompt.\n\n## Context Template\n\n**Applies to: Text Completion APIs**\n\nFor equivalent settings in Chat Completion APIs, use [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md).\n\n**Usually, AI models require you to provide the character data to them in some specific way. SillyTavern includes a list of pre-made conversion rules for different models, but you may customize them however you like.**\n\nThe options for this section are explained in [Context Template](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_context-template.md).\n\n## Tokenizer\n\nA tokenizer is a tool that breaks down a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words or even parts of words, such as prefixes, suffixes, or punctuation. A rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to 3~4 characters of text.\n\nThe options for this section are explained in [Tokenizer](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_tokenizer.md).\n\n## Custom Stopping Strings\n\nAccepts a JSON-serialized array of stopping strings. Example: `[\"\\n\", \"\\nUser:\", \"\\nChar:\"]`. If you're unsure about the formatting, use an online JSON validator (https://jsonlint.com/). If the model output **ends** with any of the stop strings, they will be removed from the output.\n\nSupported APIs:\n\n1. KoboldAI Classic (versions 1.2.2 and higher) or KoboldCpp\n2. AI Horde\n3. Text Completion APIs: Text Generation WebUI (ooba), Tabby, Aphrodite, Mancer, TogetherAI, Ollama, etc.\n4. NovelAI\n5. OpenAI (max 4 strings) and compatible APIs\n6. OpenRouter (both Text and Chat Completion)\n7. Claude\n8. Google AI Studio\n9. MistralAI\n\n## Start Reply With\n\nBy default, the Start Reply With prefix won't be shown in the resulting message. Enable \"Show reply prefix in chat\" to display it.\n\n**### Text Completion APIs**\n\nPrefills the last line of the prompt, forcing the model to continue from that point. This is useful for enforcing content, such as nudging toward the [Model Reasoning](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_reasoning.md) with the defined prefix:\n\n```txt\n<think>\nSure!\n```\n\n### Chat Completion APIs\n\nAdds an assistant role message to the end of the prompt. For some backend models, this is equivalent to prefilling the model response, but some may not support that at all and will fail with a validation error. If you're unsure, leave this field empty."

    "content": "# CFG\n\nPage written by: kingbri\n\nContributors: kingbri, Guillaume \"Vermeille\" Sanchez, AliCat\n\n## What is it?\n\nCFG, or classifier-free guidance is a method that's used to help make parts of a prompt less or more prominent.\n\n### Supported Backend APIs\n\nCurrently, the supported backends are oobabooga's textgen WebUI, NovelAI, and TabbyAPI. \nNovelAI had its own documentation for CFG (https://web.archive.org/web/20240917150051/https://docs.novelai.net/text/cfg.html).\n\nWARNING: CFG increases vram usage due to ingesting more than 1 prompt! If your GPU memory runs out while generating a prompt with CFG on, consider reducing your context size, using a lesser parameter model, or turning off CFG entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nAccessing CFG settings are the same as accessing Author's note:\n\nAnd here's what the CFG panel looks like:\n\nThere are four dropdowns in the CFG panel:\n\n- Chat CFG\n  \n  - Scopes the CFG scale and prompts to only this chat\n- Character CFG\n  \n  - Scopes the CFG scale and prompts to the specified character\n- Global CFG\n  \n  - Globally overrides the CFG scale and prompts (also overrides the model preset!)\n- CFG Advanced Settings (formerly called CFG Prompt Cascading)\n  \n  - A place to combine prompts from the previous 3 dropdowns and set insertion depth.\n\nNOTE: If the guidance scale is set to 1, nothing will be sent since that's when CFG is in an \"off\" state.\n\n#### Group Chats\n\nIn group chats, the CFG scale panel looks like this:\n\nThe main change is that character CFG is removed and a checkbox called `Use Character CFG Scales` is present in the chat CFG dropdown. This allows for the current character's guidance scale to be used instead of whatever the chat CFG scale is set to.\n\nThe main utility of this feature is to alter the scale based on each character's individual needs.\n\nIn addition, checking the `Character Negatives` box in prompt cascading will append the independent character negative prompts along with the chat ones (if enabled).\n\n---\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Isn't this in Stable Diffusion?\n\nYes and no. CFG with LLMs works in a different way than what one might be used to in Stable Diffusion. LLM-based CFG works on the principle of \"prompt mixing\". The CFG formula takes a positive and negative prompt, then mixes the *differences* between them. From there, a combined prompt is sent and a response is generated!\n\nHere's an illustration to help visualize this concept. The red represents the negative prompt, the blue represents the neutral prompt, and the purple represents the mixed result that's interpreted. All the white space is the same across all 3 prompts, so those are not used for CFG mixing.\n\nIf you want to know more about CFG and LLMs, Vermifuge's original paper is located here. I'd suggest giving it a read/listen:\n\n- Paper - [[2306.17806] Stay on topic with Classifier-Free Guidance (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs//2306.17806)\n  \n- Audio version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGY00YFcyco (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGY00YFcyco)\n  \n\n### Do I need CFG prompts?\n\nNo! CFG prompts are completely optional. Just adjusting the guidance scale above `1` will also help produce an effect on responses, which can accentuate chats and character interaction.\n\n### What makes a good CFG prompt?\n\nSo, we established that CFG prompting is not the same as Stable Diffusion's negative tags and embeddings. How do we make a prompt?\n\nWarning: This assumes that you have created a character using PLists and Ali:Chat. If you have not, feel free to experiment with various prompting techniques.\n\nLet's say I have a character named \"John\". John is supposed to feel happy and excited all the time from his example dialogues. However, when chatting with John, he's sometimes sad and depressed.\n\nTo remove this, CFG comes to the rescue! Just make the negative prompt `[John's feelings: sad, depressed]` to help remove the sadness portions. You can optionally make the positive prompt `[John's feelings: happy, joyful]` to further bring out John's happy parts.\n\n### Positive Prompts\n\nI went over this in the previous section, but I'd like to touch on this a bit more. Positive prompts are used to further accentuate parts of a character. Let's use John again as our example. By making him happier with a positive prompt of `[John's feelings: happy, joyful]`, John should start outputting dialogue with a more happy feeling than if the positive prompt was not included.\n\n### But...\n\nThese are just **loose guidelines** from experience with one specific character format. There are many other ways to create prompts that you should experiment with. Feel free to share your thoughts with other users!\n\n### Guidance Scale\n\nHere's a rule of thumb. A guidance scale of `1` means that CFG is disabled. In fact, SillyTavern won't send anything to your backend if the guidance scale is 1. A guidance scale `>1` will give the results shown in the other sections at varying degrees.\n\nHowever, a guidance scale of `<1` will give the *opposite* effect since the negative prompt is used as the primary prompt here.\n\nLet's use the example with John again. The negative prompt is `[John's feelings: sad, depressed]` and the positive prompt is `[John's feelings: happy, joyful]` with a guidance scale of `0.8`.\n\nThis will in turn accentuate the *negative* prompt more and you'll see John start to act sadder than normal rather than happier.\n\ntldr; Use a guidance scale of `1.5` and work up and down from there based on your outputs.\n\n### Prompt Cascading\n\nNegatives and positives can be cascaded between CFG types (the types being per-chat, per-character, and global overrides). See the Configuration header for more information.\n\n### Insertion Depth\n\nFollow the basic rule: The lower something is located in the prompt, the more influential it is to the response. For chatting, I recommend using the default depth of `1` since it's very flexible with other components of SillyTavern.\n\nHowever, if you want to experiment, an insertion depth of `0` is open. However, these can dramatically alter how your response will look and it's NOT recommended to use prompt cascading here!"

SillyTavern includes a list of pre-made conversion rules for different models, but you may customize them however you like.**\n\nEdit these settings in the \"[Advanced Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md)\" panel.\n\n## Story String\n\nThis field is a template for the prompt preamble (known internally as a story string). This is the main way to add the information defined in [Character Cards](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_index.md) for text completion and instruct models.\n\nThe template supports Handlebars syntax, custom text injections or formatting, and any other [macros](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_macros.md). See the language reference here: <https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/>\n\nWe provide the following parameters to the Handlebars evaluator (wrapped in double curly braces):\n\n1. `{{anchorBefore}}`: Prompts set to use the \"Before Story String\" position.\n2. `{{anchorAfter}}`: Prompts set to use the \"After Story String\" position.\n3. `{{description}}`: The character's [Description](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md).\n4. `{{scenario}}`: The character's [Scenario](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md).\n5. `{{personality}}`: The character's [Personality](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md).\n6. `{{system}}`: The [system prompt](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) OR the character's [main prompt](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) override (if it exists and \"Prefer Char. Prompt\" is enabled in User Settings).\n7. `{{persona}}`: The selected [persona's description](SillyTavern_Usage_personas.md).\n8. `{{char}}`: The character's name.\n9. `{{user}}`: The selected persona's name.\n10. `{{wiBefore}}` or `{{loreBefore}}`: Combined activated [World Info](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md) entries with Position set to \"Before Char Defs\".\n11. `{{wiAfter}}` or `{{loreAfter}}`: Combined activated [World Info](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md) entries with Position set to \"After Char Defs\".\n12. `{{mesExamples}}`: (Optional) The character's [Example Dialogues](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md), instruct-formatted with a separator.\n13. `{{mesExamplesRaw}}`: The character's [Example Dialogues](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) in raw format, without any formatting.\n\n****Important****\n\nWhen using `{{mesExamples}}` in the Story String, set **\"Example Messages Behavior\"** in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-user-cog\"></i> User Settings** panel to **\"Never include examples\"** to avoid duplicating example messages in the prompt.\n\n**A special `{{trim}}` macro is supported to remove any newlines that surround it. Use it if you want a part of the text to not be separated from the previous line by a newline (_spaces **are not** trimmed_).**\n\n**WARNING**: If any of the above parameters are missing from the story string template, they will not be sent in the prompt at all.\n\n### Prompt Anchors\n\nThe `{{anchorBefore}}` and `{{anchorAfter}}` are generic placeholders for prompts added by various extensions and miscellaneous features in a chosen static position, for example:\n\n* [Author's Note](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_Author's-Note.md)\n* [Summaries](SillyTavern_extensions_Summarize.md)\n* [Chat Vectorization](SillyTavern_extensions_Chat-vectorization.md) / [Data Bank](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_data-bank.md)\n* [STscript injections](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md)\n* [Web Search](SillyTavern_extensions_WebSearch.md)\n\n### Story String position\n\nBy default, the rendered story string (with all placeholders replaced) is placed at the very beginning of the prompt, followed by example messages and the visible chat history.\n\nAlternatively, you can move it to a dynamic position by choosing the \"In-chat @ Depth\" option, which places the story string at a specific depth in the chat context.\n\n****Attention****\n\nIf the template contains static prompt elements (model-specific prefixes or suffixes) for wrapping the story string, using the \"In-Chat @ Depth\" position will cause it to be incorrectly double-wrapped with duplicate sequences, which may lead to unexpected results.\n\nIn this case, you can fix the issue in one of the following ways:\n\n1. **Built-in templates**: Reset the templates to their defaults using the steps described in [Advanced Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md).\n2. **Custom templates**: Move the static elements from the story string template to [Story String Sequences](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_instructmode.md).\n\n**### Story String wrapping**\n\n**The following section only applies when **Instruct Mode** is ON.**\n\n*** **Default** position: The rendered Story String will be wrapped using the sequences defined in [Story String Sequences](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_instructmode.md).**\n\n* **In-chat @ Depth** position: The rendered Story String will be wrapped using the sequences defined in [Chat Messages Sequences](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_instructmode.md) for a chosen role (default: System).\n\n## Example Separator\n\nUsed as a block header and a separator between the example dialogue blocks. Any instance of `<START>` tags in the example dialogues will be replaced with the contents of this field.\n\n## Chat Start\n\nInserted as a separator after the rendered story string and after the example dialogues blocks, but before the first message in context.\n\n## Separators as Stop Strings\n\nAdds \"Example Separator\" and \"Chat Start\" to the list of stop strings.\n\nHelpful if the model tends to hallucinate or leak whole blocks of example dialogue preceded by the separator.\n\n## Names as Stop Strings\n\nAdds Character and User Persona names to the list of stop strings.\n\nRecommended to keep it on to prevent model impersonation.\n\n## Always add character's name to prompt\n\nThis setting has no effect when Instruct Mode is ON. The name behavior is instead defined by the selected [Include Names](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_instructmode.md) option.\n\n**Appends the character's name to the prompt to force the model to complete the message as the character:**\n\n```txt\n** OTHER CONTEXT HERE **\nCharacter:\n```"

    "content": "# Prompts\n\nWhen you send a message to your AI, the text you write is combined with other text to form a single request that's sent to the AI. This combined text is called a \"prompt\" or sometimes the \"request\" or \"context.\"\n\nThe prompt can include a variety of different types of text, including:\n\n* [Main instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md) to the AI about how to generate a response\n* Definitions of the [roles that the AI should take on](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md)\n* Definitions of [the role that you are taking on](SillyTavern_Usage_personas.md)\n* [Information about the \"world\"](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md) that the AI is interacting with\n* Relevant documents or information from [Data Bank](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_data-bank.md)\n* [Summaries](SillyTavern_extensions_Summarize.md) of the past conversation\n* Results of [web searches](SillyTavern_extensions_WebSearch.md) or other [external data sources](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_Function-Calling.md)\n* Previous messages in the conversation\n* **Your message to the AI**\n* [Final instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md) for the AI about how to generate a response\n\nThis can be a lot to manage! To help you understand how to structure and modify the request that's sent to the AI, SillyTavern identifies different elements that you might want to include in your prompt. You can then structure your prompt to include the things that make sense for the way you want to interact with the AI.\n\nMany of these elements are explained in the sections where you will change them. For example, to describe the role that you would like the AI to take on, you could use the [Description](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) field in [Character Design](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md).\n\n## Viewing the Prompt\n\nReading the final prompt that's sent to the AI is very helpful for understanding what the AI was told, and why it generated the response that it did. You can view the prompt in several ways:\n\n* Using the Prompt Itemization icon on the reply message from the AI\n* Using the Prompt Inspector (https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-PromptInspector) extension\n* Checking the logs in the terminal window that you're running SillyTavern in\n* Checking the console in your browser's developer tools\n\n## Changing how the Prompt is Built\n\nPresenting all the parts of your prompt to the AI in the right way is crucial for getting the best responses. You can control how the prompt is built.\n\n+++ Text Completion APIs\n\nUse the [Advanced Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) panel to customize prompt construction for Text Completion APIs.\n\n+++ Chat Completion APIs\n\nUse the [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md) to customize prompt construction for Chat Completion APIs.\n\n+++\n\n## Main Prompt (System Prompt)\n\nThe Main Prompt (or System Prompt) defines the general instructions for the model to follow. It sets the tone and context for the conversation. For example, it tells the model to act as an AI assistant, a writing partner, or a fictional character. \n\n+++ Text Completion APIs\n\nThe [System Prompt](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) is a part of the [Story String](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_context-template.md) and usually the first part of the prompt that the model receives.\n\n+++ Chat Completion APIs\n\nThe Main Prompt is one of the default prompts in [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md). It is usually the first message in the context that the model receives, attributed to (\"sent by\") the system role.\n\n+++\n\nThe default Main Prompt is:\n\n> Write \\{\\{char\\}\\}'s next reply in a fictional chat between \\{\\{char\\}\\} and \\{\\{user\\}\\}.\n\nThe \\{\\{char\\}\\} and \\{\\{user\\}\\} placeholders are replaced with the names of the character and persona that you've defined in the conversation. \n\nYou can use any of the supported [\\{\\{macro\\}\\}](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_macros.md) tags in the Main Prompt to include information that might vary between conversations or changes as the conversation progresses.\n\n### Adjusting the Main Prompt\n\nThe default main prompt helps the model understand what it's expected to do with the character and persona information that follows, how to interpret the past conversation, and what kind of response to generate. It's a flexible general-purpose prompt that works well for many situations, because it establishes that the AI is writing as a character in a conversation with your persona.\n\nHowever, you can adjust the main prompt to better suit your needs. Here are some common reasons to adjust the main prompt:\n\n* **Provide additional instructions**: for example, you want the AI to explain its reasoning, follow specific rules, or avoid certain topics\n* **Clarify the role of the AI**: for example, you want the AI to act as a narrator, a storyteller, or a guide\n* **Change the context of the conversation**: for example, you want the AI to respond as if it were an AI assistant, text adventure game, or a writing partner\n\n**Try things out and see what works best for you**\n\nAll the examples in this guide have worked well for other users, but the prompt that works for your needs and the model you're using might be different. Experiment with different instructions and prompting styles to see what works best for you. If you're not sure what to try, you can always ask for help in the SillyTavern Discord (https://discord.gg/sillytavern).\n\n**Giving the AI additional instructions in the Main Prompt can help it understand what you want from the conversation.**\n\n> Write one reply only. Write at least one paragraph, up to four.\n\n> Markdown is enabled. Use it to format your response. Enclose code snippets in triple backticks.\n\n> Write character dialogue in quotation marks. Write \\{\\{char\\}\\}'s thoughts in parentheses.\n\n> You are an anime roleplay generation model for users aged 13 to 17. You always generate fun, age-appropriate responses.\n\n> Answer truthfully and write out your thinking step by step to be sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe AI will more easily follow instructions about what it should do than what it should not do. For example, if you want the AI to avoid writing in a certain way, it's better to tell it how you want it to write instead. And while *\"Do not decide what \\{\\{user\\}\\} says or does\"* is commonly included in prompts to prevent the AI from controlling your persona, some users find *\"Write  \\{\\{char\\}\\}'s responses in a way that respects  \\{\\{user\\}\\}'s autonomy\"* is more effective.\n\nThere is often a better place than the Main Prompt to include information about the user or characters, modify a character's writing and speaking style, or give other specific instructions. The Main Prompt is best used for general instructions about the conversation as a whole, or about a type of conversation that you want to have.\n\n### Effect of Message History\n\nWhen adjusting the main prompt to improve the AI's responses, consder that the AI picks up a lot from the message history. The history is its memory of past events, character interactions and relationships, and its style guide for word choice and writing style.\n\nUse this to your advantage by also providing [example messages](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) showing how you want the AI to respond. Showing what you want is often easier than trying to explain it!\n\nWhen your conversation already has history, changing the main prompt has a limited effect on the AI's responses. In terms of events and relationships, the AI assumes that the main prompt occurred in the distant past, and the message history updates it. In terms of writing style and word choice, the AI assumes that all the messages in history were generated according to the rules in the *current* main prompt, and that it should continue to generate messages in the same way. Some suggestions for dealing with this are:\n\n* insert current instructions close to or after the end of message history, for example by using an [Author's Note](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_Author's-Note.md)\n* test your changes to the main prompt by starting a new conversation\n* edit the message history to remove or correct examples of unwanted behaviour\n* use the [Post-History Instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md) to provide final instructions to the AI\n\n**Get it right the first time!**\n\nNever let the AI \"get away\" with something you don't want it to do. If you don't like the AI's response, don't continue the conversation as if it was correct. Instead, modify the prompts, regenerate the message, and continue from there. This will help the AI learn what you want.\n\n**### Removing the \"Fictional Chat\" Context**\n\nThere are situations where \"fictional chat\" might not be the right context for your conversation. \n\nYou can remove the \"fictional\" context from the Main Prompt:\n\n> Write \\{\\{char\\}\\}'s next reply in a conversation with \\{\\{user\\}\\}.\n\nYou may not want the AI to think of itself as role-playing at all. Instead of removing the idea of a character, you can remove the idea of an AI:\n\n> You are \\{\\{char\\}\\}, a helpful assistant. You provide useful information and help \\{\\{user\\}\\} with their questions.\n\n### AI as Narrator or Storyteller\n\nWhat if you want the AI to act as a narrator, describing events from an omniscient perspective, inventing its own characters and settings?\n\nOne approach is to create a named character for the AI to use as a narrator. This character could be called \"Narrator\" or \"AI\", suggesting that the AI is a general-purpose storyteller, or it could be named after a specific scenario or setting, giving the AI the task of narrating a story in that setting. The details of the setting can then be defined in the [Character](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) or in [World Info](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md).\n\nYou will need to adjust the default main prompt to reflect the AI's role. For a general-purpose narrator, you might use:\n\n> You are \\{\\{char\\}\\}, a skilled and versatile storyteller. Narrate the story.\n\nor for a specific setting:\n\n> You are the narrator of a fantasy scenario. Play as the characters that visit \\{\\{char\\}\\}.\n\nIt helps to clarify the role of the user in the conversation. Are your messages part of the story, or are they instructions to the narrator about what your character does or says? An example that includes the user in the story:\n\n> The story should progress by responding to the actions and dialogue of \\{\\{user\\}\\}. Narrate the story in third person.\n\nAn example that keeps the user out of the story:\n\n> Enter Adventure Mode. Narrate the story based on \\{\\{user\\}\\}'s dialogue and actions after \">\". Describe the surroundings in vivid detail. Be detailed, creative, verbose, and proactive. Move the story forward by introducing fantasy elements and interesting characters.\n\nDefining the role of the user not only helps the AI understand how to respond to your messages, but also to what extent it is allowed to control your persona. This avoids situations where the AI makes decisions for your persona that you would rather make yourself.\n\n## Post-History Instructions\n\nPost-History Instructions (PHI) are additional instructions sent to the AI after the main prompt and the user message. They can be used to provide additional context or instructions to the AI based on the message history.\n\nSince the Post-History Instructions are sent after the user message, they are the final instructions that the AI receives before generating a response. The AI usually gives them a higher priority than the main prompt, and they can override the main prompt's instructions.\n\nTo use per-character Post-History Instructions, add them to the character's [Post-History Instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_characterdesign.md) and enable [Prefer Char. Instructions](SillyTavern_Usage_User_Settings_index.md). To preserve the globally defined PHI while using character-specific instructions, you can use the `{{original}}` macro in the character's Post-History Instructions field.\n\n+++ Text Completion APIs\n\nPost-History Instructions are defined in the [Advanced Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) panel under the System Prompt category. The Post-History Instructions is added as an invisible user role injection that precedes the last line of the prompt (usually containing a response message \"header\"). Note that the \"Enable System Prompt\" toggle must be enabled for the Post-History Instructions to be applied (even if the System Prompt itself is empty).\n\n+++ Chat Completion APIs\n\nPost-History Instructions is one of the default prompts in [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md). It is usually the last message in the context that the model receives, attributed to (\"sent by\") the system role. If your Chat Completion API does not support the system role, it will usually be attributed to the user role instead.\n\n+++\n\n## Adding to the Prompt (World Info)\n\nYou can insert additional information anywhere in the prompt using the [World Info](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md) feature. By setting the conditions for when the information should be inserted, you can guide the AI to include specific details, change how it responds, or add new elements to the conversation.\n\nSome common uses of World Info include:\n\n* a \"lorebook\" or \"encyclopedia\" with information about the world or setting\n* a way to manage different system prompts for various characters and situations\n* a place to store memories that the AI should \"recall\" in the conversation\n* a more modular system for creating, editing, and sharing character details\n* a source of random events and surprises for the AI to react to, or to make you react to!"

    "content": "# Instruct Mode\n\nInstruct Mode allows you to adjust the prompting for instruction-following models trained on various prompt formats, such as Alpaca, ChatML, Llama2, etc.\n\n**Applies to: Text Completion APIs**\n\nFor equivalent settings in Chat Completion APIs, use [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md).\n\n**## API support**\n\n### Text Completion API\n\nFully supported. This includes:\n\n* All of the sources under Text Completion\n* KoboldAI Classic\n* AI Horde\n\n#### Choosing a formatting\n\nA chosen instruct template must match the expectations of an actual model that is running on a backend.\n\nThis is usually reflected in a model card on HuggingFace, and some even provide SillyTavern-compatible JSON files.\n\nExample: NeverSleep/Noromaid-13b-v0.1.1 (https://huggingface.co/NeverSleep/Noromaid-13b-v0.1.1#prompt-template-custom-format-or-alpaca)\n\n### Chat Completion API (OpenAI, Claude, etc)\n\nThis is not supported **(and not needed)** for Chat Completion APIs. They use an entirely different prompt builder.\n\n### NovelAI\n\nWhile *technically* supported for NovelAI, none of their models were trained to understand instruct formatting. NovelAI models can use a special instruct module that is activated *automatically* when an instruction wrapped in curly braces is encountered in chat messages, so using Instruct Mode for the entire prompt will lead to **degraded quality** of the outputs.\n\nHere's an example that auto-activates the instruct module for NovelAI:\n\n```txt\nUser: { Write a happy song about Nintendo Switch. }\n```\n\n## Instruct Mode Settings\n\n### System Prompt\n\n**Recent change**\n\nThe System Prompt is now a separate entity. See the [Advanced Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) page for more details.\n\n**### Templates**\n\nProvides ready-made templates with sequences for some well-known instruct models.\n\n*Changing a template resets the unsaved settings to the last saved state! Don't forget to save your template if you made any changes you don't want to lose.*\n\n### Activation Regex\n\nIf defined as a valid regular expression, when connected to a model and its name matches this regex, will automatically select this template.\n\nInstruct mode needs to be enabled prior. Only the first regex match across templates will be selected (evaluated in alphabetical order).\n\n### Wrap Sequences with Newline\n\nEach sequence text will be wrapped with newline characters when inserted into the prompt. Required for Alpaca and its derivatives.\n\nDisable if you want to have full control over line terminators.\n\n### Replace Macro in Sequences\n\nIf enabled, known \\{\\{macro\\}\\} substitutions will be replaced if defined in message wrapping sequences.\n\nAlso, a special \\{\\{name\\}\\} macro can be used in message prefixes to reference the actual name attached to a message (rather than a currently active \\{\\{char\\}\\} or \\{\\{user\\}\\}), which can be helpful when using group chats or /sendas command. If the name can't be determined, \"System\" is used as a fallback placeholder.\n\n### Include Names\n\nIf enabled, prepend characters and user names to chat history logs after the prefix sequence.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n* **Never**: Do not add name prefixes before the message contents.\n* **Groups and Past Personas**: Only add name prefixes to messages from group characters and past personas.\n* **Always**: Always add name prefixes before the message contents.\n\n### Sequences: Story String Wrapping\n\n**Recent change**\n\nSystem Prompt wrapping has been removed and replaced with Story String wrapping.\n\n**Define how the Story String will be wrapped when the Position is set to \"Default (top of context)\"**\n\n#### Story String Prefix\n\nInserted before a Story String.\n\n#### Story String Suffix\n\nInserted after a Story String.\n\n### Sequences: Chat Messages Wrapping\n\nThese settings define how messages belonging to different roles will be wrapped upon building a prompt.\n\nAll prefix sequences will also be automatically used as stopping strings.\n\n#### User Message Prefix\n\nInserted before a User message and as a last prompt line when impersonating.\n\n#### User Message Suffix\n\nInserted after a User message.\n\n#### Assistant Message Prefix\n\nInserted before an Assistant message and as a last prompt line when generating an AI reply.\n\n#### Assistant Message Suffix\n\nInserted after an Assistant message\n\n#### System Message Prefix\n\nInserted before a System (added by slash commands or extensions) message.\n\n#### System Message Suffix\n\nInserted after a System message.\n\n#### System same as User\n\nIf checked true, System messages will be using User role message sequences.\n\nOtherwise, System messages use their own sequences (if not empty) or will not do any wrapping at all (if empty).\n\n### Misc. Sequences\n\nVarious advanced configurations for finer tuning of the prompt building\n\n#### First Assistant Prefix\n\nInserted before the first Assistant's message.\n\nOnly the first message of the **chat history** counts, not the message that actually goes into the prompt first!\n\n**#### Last Assistant Prefix**\n\nInserted before the last Assistant's message or as a last prompt line when generating an AI reply.\n\nNot used when generating text in a background (e.g. Stable Diffusion prompts or Summaries). System Instruction Prefix or Regular Assistant Prefix will be used instead.\n\n**#### System Instruction Prefix**\n\nInserted as a last prompt line when generating neutral/system text in a background (e.g. Stable Diffusion prompts or Summaries).\n\n#### User Filler Message\n\nWill be inserted at the start of the chat history if it doesn't start with a User message.\n\n**Use case:** when an instruct format *strictly requires* prompts to be user-first and have messages with alternating roles only, examples: Llama 2 Chat, Mistral Instruct.\n\n#### Stop Sequence\n\nText that denotes the end of the reply. Also sent as a stopping string to the backend API.\n\nIf a stop sequence is generated, everything past it will be removed from the output (including the sequence itself)."

If a Chat Completion model is having trouble determining which messages belong to which character, it may need a different strategy selected.\n\n## Continue Postfix\n\nWhen Continue is triggered, the 'continued' message returned by the model will have the selected Continue Postfix prepended to the beginning. For example, it can add a space before the continued text.\n\n## Additional Settings\n\n### Wrap in Quotes\n\nDeprecated option. Prefer [Regex scripts](SillyTavern_extensions_Regex.md) instead.\n\n**Wraps the entire user message in hidden quotation marks before sending.

For one of these prompts to be added to the outgoing message, it needs to be selected from the dropdown list and then added to the Prompt Manager by pressing the **Insert prompt** button. To create a new prompt to add to this dropdown list, press the **New prompt** button. Once the new prompt is written and saved, it is added to the dropdown and can then be inserted.\n\n### Prompts List\n\nThis is a drag-and-drop interface that lists the prompts selected to potentially be sent to the Chat Completion model. Prompts placed closer to the **top** of the interface are sent earlier. The **bottom** of the list is the **last thing** sent to the model (typically, this would be your **Post-History Instructions**).\n\n**'Pinned' prompts = Default prompts**\n\nThe default prompts cannot be removed from the list of selected prompts. This includes Main Prompt, World Info (before/after), Persona Description, Character Description, Character Personality, Scenario, Enhance Definitions, Auxiliary Prompt, Chat Examples, Chat History, and Post-History Instructions. If these are not desired, they can be **toggled 'OFF'**, but not removed or deleted outright.\n\n**## Editing a Prompt**\n\nClicking the **pencil button** on a prompt will bring you to the **Edit interface**. Here, you can edit the prompt directly.\n\n**Make sure to save your changes!**\n\nTo permanently save changes to these prompts in your Chat Completion preset, you must click the **Save** button in the bottom right of the **Edit interface**, as well as save the preset itself by using the **Save** button located at the top of the **AI Response Configuration** section! Otherwise, changes made will be lost when the Chat Completion preset is switched to a different one.\n\n**### Name**\n\nThe name of the prompt. This is not sent to the Chat Completion model; it is for your reference within the Prompt Manager only.\n\n### Role\n\nWhich role sends the prompt. You can choose between System, AI Assistant, or User.\n\n### Triggers\n\nThe generation types for which this prompt is sent. If nothing is selected, the prompt will be sent for all generation types. If one or more are selected, the prompt will only be sent for those specific generation types:\n\n- **Normal:** Regular message generation request.\n- **Continue:** When the Continue button is pressed.\n- **Impersonate:** When the Impersonate button is pressed.\n- **Swipe:** When the generation is triggered by swiping.\n- **Regenerate:** When the Regenerate button is pressed in solo chats.\n- **Quiet:** Background generation requests, usually triggered by [extensions](SillyTavern_extensions_index.md) or [STscript](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md) commands.\n\n**The \"Regenerate\" trigger is not available in group chats as it uses different regeneration logic: all messages from the last reply are deleted, and messages are queued using the \"Normal\" generation type according to the chosen [Group reply strategy](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_groupchats.md).**\n\n**### Position**\n\nWhen Position is set to **Relative**, this prompt is sent where it's located in the drag-and-drop interface with all other prompts. When it is set to **In-Chat** and given a **Depth**, it is instead sent **within the Chat History** as the selected Role, and **ignores** the order of the drag-and-drop interface.\n\n### Depth\n\nWhen Position is set to **In-Chat**, this defines how deep the prompt is sent within the chat history. The higher the number, the deeper it is sent. For example, a Depth of 0 will be sent after the last chat message, a Depth of 1 will be sent before the last chat message, and a Depth of 2 will be sent before the second-to-last chat message, and so on.\n\n### Order\n\n**Prompts that have the same Role and Depth will be grouped together and ordered by their Order value.**\n\nThe order is as follows (from top to bottom): User, AI Assistant, System.\n\n**When Position is set to **In-Chat**, this defines the order in which the prompt is sent within the chat history. The lower the number, the earlier it is sent.**\n\n## Building Your Prompt: Tips and Tricks\n\nVisit the [prompt-building](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_index.md) section of the SillyTavern documentation for more information on how to write effective prompts.

    "content": "# Reasoning\n\nIn language models, reasoning (also known as model thinking) refers to a chain-of-thought (CoT) technique that mirrors human problem-solving through step-by-step analysis. SillyTavern provides several features that make the use of reasoning models more efficient and consistent across supported backends.\n\n## Common issues\n\n1. When using reasoning models, the model's internal reasoning process consumes part of your response token allowance, even if this reasoning isn't shown in the final output (e.g. o3-mini or Gemini Thinking). If you notice your responses are coming back incomplete or empty, you should try adjusting the Max Response Length setting found in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-sliders\"></i>\u00a0AI Response Configuration** panel. For reasoning models, it's typical to use significantly higher token limits - anywhere from 1024 to 4096 tokens - compared to standard conversational models.\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Most reasoning-related settings can be configured in the \"Reasoning\" section of **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-font\"></i>\u00a0Advanced Formatting** panel.**\n\n**Reasoning blocks appear in the chat as collapsible message sections. They can be added manually, automatically by the backend, or through response parsing (see below).**\n\nBy default, reasoning blocks are collapsed to save space. Click a block to expand and view its contents. You can set blocks to expand automatically by enabling **Auto-Expand** in the reasoning settings.\n\nWhen a reasoning block is expanded, you can copy or edit its contents using the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-copy\"></i>\u00a0Copy** and **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-pencil\"></i>\u00a0Edit** buttons.\n\nSome models models support reasoning, but will not send their thoughts back. It is possible to still show the reasoning block with reasoning time for those by toggling the **Show Hidden** setting.\n\n## Adding Reasoning\n\n### Manually\n\nAdd a reasoning block to any message through the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-pencil\"></i>\u00a0Message Edit** menu. Click **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-lightbulb\"></i>** while editing to add a reasoning section. Third-party extensions can also add reasoning by writing to the `extra.reasoning` field of the message object before adding it to the chat.\n\n### With a Command\n\nUse the `/reasoning-set` STscript command to add reasoning to a message. The command takes `at` (message ID, defaults to the last message) and reasoning text as arguments.\n\n```stscript\n/reasoning-set at=0 This is the reasoning for the first message.\n```\n\n### By Backend\n\nIf your chosen LLM backend and model support reasoning output, enabling \"Request model reasoning\" in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-sliders\"></i>\u00a0AI Response Configuration** panel will add a reasoning block containing the model's thinking process.\n\nSupported sources:\n\n- Claude\n- DeepSeek\n- Google AI Studio\n- Google Vertex AI\n- OpenRouter\n- xAI (Grok)\n- AI/ML API\n- Z.AI\n- Pollinations\n- MistralAI\n- Electron Hub\n- Chutes\n- NanoGPT\n\n**For **most** sources, \"Request model reasoning\" does not determine whether a model does reasoning as it can't be disabled. If the backend and model support explicitly requesting disabled reasoning, the setting will do so. Otherwise, the model will always reason.**\n\n**Provider-specific notes:**\n\n- Claude and Google (2.5 Flash) allow thinking mode to be toggled; see [Reasoning Effort](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md).\n- Reasoning can be disabled for Z.AI (GLM). The setting maps the to `thinking.type` parameter, see the documentation (https://docs.z.ai/api-reference/llm/chat-completion#body-one-of-0-thinking). It does not support \"Reasoning Effort\".\n\n### By Parsing\n\nEnable \"Auto-Parse\" in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-font\"></i>\u00a0Advanced Formatting** panel to automatically parse reasoning from the model's output.\n\nThe response must contain a reasoning section wrapped in configured Prefix and Suffix sequences. The sequences provided by default correspond to the DeepSeek R1 reasoning format.\n\nExample with prefix `<think>` and suffix `</think>`:\n\n```txt\n<think>\nThis is the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThis is the main content.\n```\n\n## Prompting with Reasoning\n\nBy default, recognized reasoning block contents are not sent back to the model. To include reasoning in prompts, enable \"Add to Prompts\" in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-font\"></i>\u00a0Advanced Formatting** panel. Reasoning content will be wrapped in configured Prefix and Suffix sequences and separated by a Separator from the main context. The Max Additions numeric setting controls how many reasoning blocks can be included, counting from the end of the prompt.\n\n**Most model providers do not recommend sending CoT back to the model in multi-turn conversations.**\n\n**### Continuing from Reasoning**\n\nA special case when the reasoning can be sent back to the model without having the \"Add to Prompts\" toggle enabled is when the generation is continued (e.g. by pressing \"Continue\" from the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-bars\"></i> Options** menu), but the message being continued contains only the reasoning without an actual content. This gives the model an opportunity to finish an incomplete reasoning and start generating the main content. The prompt will be sent as follows:\n\n```txt\n<think>\nIncomplete reasoning...\n```\n\n## Regex Scripts\n\nRegular expression scripts from the [Regex extension](SillyTavern_extensions_Regex.md) can be applied to the contents of reasoning blocks. Check \"Reasoning\" in the \"Affects\" section of the script editor to target reasoning blocks specifically.\n\nDifferent ephemerality options affect reasoning blocks in the following ways:\n\n1. No ephemerality: reasoning content is permanently changed.\n2. Run on edit: regex script will be re-evaluated when the reasoning block is edited.\n3. Alter chat display: regex is applied to the reasoning block's display text, not the underlying content.\n4. Alter outgoing prompts: regex is only applied to reasoning blocks before they are sent to the model.\n\n## Reasoning Effort\n\nReasoning Effort is a Chat Completion setting in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-sliders\"></i>\u00a0AI Response Configuration** panel that influences how many tokens may potentially be used on reasoning. The effect of each option depends on the source connected to. For the sources below, Auto simply means the relevant parameter is not included in the request.\n\n| Option  | Claude (\u2264 21333 if no streaming) | OpenAI (keyword)     | OpenRouter (keyword)             | xAI (Grok) (keyword) | Perplexity (keyword) |\n| ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Models  | Opus 4, Sonnet 4/3.7             | o4-mini, o3\\*, o1\\*  | applicable models                | grok-3-mini          | sonar-deep-research  |\n| Auto    | not specified, **no thinking**   | not specified        | not specified, effect depends    | not specified        | not specified        |\n| Minimum | budgets 1024 tokens              | \"low\"                | \"low\", or 20% of max response    | \"low\"                | \"low\"                |\n| Low     | 15% of max response, min 1024    | \"low\"                | \"low\", or 20% of max response    | \"low\"                | \"low\"                |\n| Medium  | 25% of max response, min 1024    | \"medium\"             | \"medium\", or 50% of max response | \"low\"                | \"medium\"             |\n| High    | 50% of max response, min 1024    | \"high\"               | \"high\", or 80% of max response   | \"high\"               | \"high\"               |\n| Maximum | 95% of max response, min 1024    | \"high\"               | \"high\", or 80% of max response   | \"high\"               | \"high\"               |\n\n- For Claude, budget is capped to 21333 if streaming is disabled. If the calculated budget would be less than 1024, then max response is changed to 2048.\n- For OpenRouter, Perplexity and AI/ML API, only an OpenAI-style keyword is sent.\n\nGoogle AI Studio and Vertex AI are as follows:\n\n| Model          | Auto (dynamic thinking) | Minimum            | Low                          | Medium     | High       | Maximum               |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- |\n| 2.5 Pro        | thinkingBudget = -1     | 128                | 15% of max response, min 128 | 25% of max | 50% of max | lower of max or 32768 |\n| 2.5 Flash      | thinkingBudget = -1     | 0, **no thinking** | 15% of max response          | 25% of max | 50% of max | lower of max or 24576 |\n| 2.5 Flash Lite | thinkingBudget = -1     | 0, **no thinking** | 15% of max response, min 512 | 25% of max | 50% of max | lower of max or 24576 |\n| 3.0 Pro        | thinkingLevel = null    | \"low\"              | \"low\"                        | \"low\"      | \"high\"     | \"high\"                |\n| 3.0 Flash      | thinkingLevel = null    | \"minimal\"          | \"low\"                        | \"medium\"   | \"high\"     | \"high\"                |\n\n- For Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash/Lite, budget is capped to 32768 or 24576 tokens respectively, regardless of the streaming setting."

    "content": "# Tokenizer\n\nA tokenizer is a tool that breaks down a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words or even parts of words, such as prefixes, suffixes, or punctuation. A rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to 3~4 characters of text.\n\nSillyTavern provides a \"Best match\" option that tries to match the tokenizer using the following rules depending on the API provider used.\n\nText Completion APIs **(overridable)**:\n\n1. NovelAI Clio: NerdStash tokenizer.\n2. NovelAI Kayra: NerdStash v2 tokenizer.\n3. Text Completion: API tokenizer (if supported) or Llama tokenizer.\n4. KoboldAI Classic / AI Horde: Llama tokenizer.\n5. KoboldCpp: model API tokenizer.\n\nIf you get inaccurate results or wish to experiment, you can set an _override tokenizer_ for SillyTavern to use while forming a request to the AI backend:\n\n1. None. Each token is estimated to be ~3.3 characters, rounded up to the nearest integer. **Try this if your prompts get cut off on high context lengths.** This approach is used by KoboldAI Lite.\n2. Llama tokenizer. Used by Llama 1/2 models family: Vicuna, Hermes, Airoboros, etc. **Pick if you use a Llama 1/2 model.**\n3. Llama 3 tokenizer. Used by Llama 3/3.1 models. **Pick if you use a Llama 3/3.1 model.**\n4. NerdStash tokenizer. Used by NovelAI's Clio model. **Pick if you use the Clio model.**\n5. NerdStash v2 tokenizer. Used by NovelAI's Kayra model. **Pick if you use the Kayra model.**\n6. Mistral V1 tokenizer. Used by older Mistral models family and their finetunes. **Pick if you use an older Mistral model.**\n7. Mistral Nemo tokenizer. Used by Mistral Nemo models family and their finetunes. **Pick if you use a Mistral Nemo/Pixtral model.**\n8. Yi tokenizer. Used by Yi models. **Pick if you use a Yi model.**\n9. Gemma tokenizer. Used by Gemini/Gemma models. **Pick if you use a Gemma model.**\n10. DeepSeek tokenizer. Used by DeepSeek models (such as R1). **Pick if you use a DeepSeek model.**\n11. API tokenizer. Queries the generation API to get the token count directly from the model. Known backends to support: Text Generation WebUI (ooba), koboldcpp, TabbyAPI, Aphrodite API. **Pick if you use a supported backend.**\n\nChat Completion APIs **(non-overridable)**:\n\n1. OpenAI: model-dependant tokenizer via tiktoken (https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).\n2. Claude: model-dependant tokenizer via WebTokenizers (https://github.com/mlc-ai/tokenizers-cpp).\n3. OpenRouter: Llama, Mistral, Gemma, Yi tokenizers for their respective models.\n4. Google AI Studio: Gemma tokenizer.\n5. AI21 API: Jamba tokenizer (requires a one-time download).\n6. Cohere API: Command-R or Command-A tokenizer (requires a one-time download).\n7. MistralAI API: Mistral V1 or V3 tokenizer (requires a one-time download).\n8. DeepSeek API: DeepSeek tokenizer (requires a one-time download).\n9. Fallback tokenizer: GPT-3.5 turbo tokenizer.\n\n#### Additional Tokenizers\n\nThese tokenizers are not included in the default installation due to their size A one-time download is required when they're used for the first time.\n\n1. Qwen2 tokenizer.\n2. Command-R / Command-A tokenizers. Used by Cohere source in Chat Completion.\n3. Mistral V3 (Nemo) tokenizer. Used by MistralAI source in Chat Completion (Nemo and Pixtral models).\n4. DeepSeek (deepseek-chat) tokenizer. Used by DeepSeek source in Chat Completion.\n\nIf you don't want to use internet downloads, the opt-out option exists in config.yaml: `enableDownloadableTokenizers`. Set to `false` to disable downloads.\n\nYou can also download tokenizers manually from the SillyTavern-Tokenizers (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Tokenizers) repository. Download the JSON files and put them in the `_cache` subdirectory of your data root, the path is `./data/_cache` by default. Create the `_cache` directory if it doesn't exist. After that, restart the SillyTavern server to re-initialize tokenizers.\n\nIf the required tokenizer model is not cached and downloads are disabled, a fallback tokenizer (Llama 3) will be used for counting.\n\n### Token Padding\n\n**Applies to: Text Completion APIs**\n\nSillyTavern will always use the matching tokenizer for Chat Completion models, so there is no need for token padding.\n\n**Unless SillyTavern uses a tokenizer provided by the remote backend API that runs the model, all token counts assumed during prompt generation are estimated based on the selected [tokenizer](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts.md) type.**\n\nSince the results of tokenization can be inaccurate on context sizes close to the model-defined maximum, some parts of the prompt may be trimmed or dropped, which may negatively affect the coherence of character definitions.\n\nTo prevent this, SillyTavern allocates a portion of the context size as padding to avoid adding more chat items than the model can accommodate. If you find that some part of the prompt is trimmed even with the most-matching tokenizer selected, adjust the padding so the description is not truncated.\n\nYou can input negative values for reverse padding, which allows allocating more than the set maximum amount of tokens."

    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/usage/user/settings/visual-novel",
    "content": "# Visual Novel (VN) Mode\n\nVisual Novel Mode is a special screen layout in SillyTavern that allows you to chat to characters with sprites (or their character card image) that resembles that of a visual novel like Doki Doki Literature Club, The Fruits of Grisaia, Fate: Stay/night and other famous VN games.\n\n## Toggling Visual Novel Mode\n\n### Enabling Visual Novel Mode\n\nVisual Novel Mode comes built in with SillyTavern and can be toggle by going to *User Settings* (User Settings Icon) and checking **Visual Novel Mode** below *No Text Shadows*.\n\n### Disabling Visual Novel Mode\n\nDisabling Visual Novel Mode is the same steps as enabling it. Untoggle Visual Novel Mode and you should be back to the normal chat screen itself.\n\n**Regarding VN Mode with VN Extensions**\n\nSome extensions (like the Prome VN Extension) will toggle 'Visual Novel Mode' on if you use their own respective VN modes. Enabling/Disabling VN Mode from the *User Settings* menu will also affect these extensions as well.\n\n**## The Visual Novel UI**\n\nIn Visual Novel Mode, the UI is altered slightly in order to accommodate character sprites (or the character card image) which is shown in the center. In a group chat with multiple characters however, the character sprites will spread themselves out, accommodating for each other as shown below.\n\n### VN Mode with MovingUI\n\nTo toggle MovingUI, go to *User Settings* and check on **MovingUI**. Do note that this feature **only** works on Desktops.\n\n**If **MovingUI** is enabled in *User Settings*, the sprites (or character card image) can be moved around if you wish to move them around or place them in a more specific area on the screen.**\n\n**Regarding Sprite Sizes**\n\nIf the size of your character sprites are relatively big it will be a challenge to try and move certain sprites around with MovingUI as the button to drag sprites around might be covered underneath a existing sprite. You will probably have to move them around a bit more than normal, especially if there is more characters on the screen for better placement.\n\n**## Obtaining Character Sprites**\n\nObtaining character sprites can be done by browsing the internet for existing sprites, for say, a existing character from a Visual Novel or a game that uses a Visual Novel feature such as DDLC or CounterSide. If the character you desire sprites form does not come with sprites already, you have several options remaining.\n\n1. Search the character post for any sprite ZIP package or link to a sprite pack.\n\n    Some bot creators may release their bots with a sprite pack (either within the same post or in a sprites channel). Search those posts if someone hasn't made sprites of the character you want already.\n\n**2. Create your own using LoRAs and Stable Diffusion.**\n\n    Generating sprites from scratch is time-consuming (especially if no LoRAs exist for your character and/or for the Stable Diffusion model you want to use) and will require decent hardware in order to generate them, more so if you plan on making 28 sprite expression than 6 and if you are using SDXL and/or upscaling sprites to a more higher resolution.\n\n**3. Use the character card image. It might not be like a sprite, but at least you have something to look at on-screen. However, multiple character cards cannot be used in VN mode.**\n\n**Character Card Images with the Prome Visual Novel Extension**\n\n    With the Prome Visual Novel Extension 1.0.6+, there is a feature called `Emulate Character Card as Sprite` that allows you to have a group chat with both sprite and non-sprite characters by using their character card as a sprite in chat.\n\n**## VN Extensions**\n\n### Prome Visual Novel Extension\n\nThe Prome Visual Novel Extension is an endorsed third-party extension from Bronya Rand and Prometheus that enhances the visual novel experience in SillyTavern even further with features such as Letterbox Mode which makes the visual novel UI more \"cinematic\", Focus Mode with Darken Character Sprites, Traditional VN Mode where only the last message in chat appears in chat and more planned to come!\n\n|                              Letterbox Mode                              |                          Traditional VN Mode                           |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n\n|                 Hide Sheld (Message Box)                  |                      Focus Mode (w/ Darken Sprites)                      |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n\nTo install the Prome Visual Novel Extension, you can either install by going to `Download Extensions & Assets` and finding *Prome Visual Novel Extension*, or follow the installation instructions on the Prome Visual Novel Extension (https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/Prome-VN-Extension?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-usage) Github page. Adjusting Prome's settings can be found either in *Extensions* -> **Prome (Visual Novel Extension)** or via the \ud83e\ude84 (Wand) menu."

    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/usage/welcome-assistants",
    "content": "# Welcome Page Assistants\n\nSillyTavern features a Welcome Screen that can greet you with a designated \"Assistant\" character. This screen appears when you launch SillyTavern without an active chat or after you close your last chat session.\n\nIf you don't see a Welcome Screen on app startup, make sure the \"Auto-Load Last Chat\" option is disabled in the \"Chat/Message Handling\" section of the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-user-cog\"></i> User Settings** panel. If this option is enabled, SillyTavern will automatically load your last chat instead of showing the Welcome Screen.\n\n**## The Welcome Screen**\n\nWhen no chat is active, the Welcome Screen provides several useful elements:\n\n* **SillyTavern Version:** Displays the application's logo and current version.\n* **Quick Links:** Easy access to:\n  * **Docs:** Opens the official SillyTavern documentation (you're already here!).\n  * **GitHub:** Takes you to the SillyTavern GitHub repository (<https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern>).\n  * **Discord:** Provides a link to the official SillyTavern Discord server (<https://discord.gg/sillytavern>).\n* **Temporary Chat Button:** Allows you to quickly start a new, temporary chat session with the default neutral assistant, which won't be saved to your chat history unless you explicitly save it.\n* **Recent Chats Section:** Lists your recent conversations for quick access. You can:\n  * Show or hide this section.\n  * Expand the list if more than 3 chats are available (up to 15 recent chats).\n\n## Temporary Chat\n\nDue to a technical limitation, the Temporary Chat feature will not use your customized Welcome Page Assistant. It will always start an empty chat without any additional prompts or character information.\n\n**The Temporary Chat button allows you to quickly start a new chat session without saving it to your chat history. This is useful for testing or casual conversations without cluttering your saved chats. This chat will be deleted as soon as you close it or switch to another chat.**\n\n* **Save** button will allow you to export the temporary chat as a JSONL file, which you can then import later.\n* **Load** button will allow you to restore a previously saved temporary chat file.\n\n## What is a Welcome Page Assistant?\n\nA Welcome Page Assistant is a character you choose to be featured on the Welcome Screen. This allows for a personalized greeting and a quick way to start a chat with a familiar character right from the start.\n\n### Setting and Unsetting an Assistant\n\nYou can choose any of your characters to act as your Welcome Page Assistant.\n\n**To set an assistant:**\n\n1. Navigate to the **Character Management** panel (usually found in the right-hand sidebar via the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-address-card\"></i> icon).\n2. Find the character you wish to set as your assistant in the list.\n3. Click on \"More...\" and select **\"Set / Unset as Welcome Page Assistant\"** from the dropdown menu.\n4. A small icon (<i class=\"fa-solid fa-user-graduate\"></i>) will appear next to the character's name, indicating they are now your active Welcome Page Assistant.\n\n**To unset an assistant:**\n\n1. Go to the Character Management panel.\n2. Locate your current Welcome Page Assistant (they will have the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-user-graduate\"></i> icon).\n3. Click on \"More...\" and select **\"Set / Unset as Welcome Page Assistant\"** again.\n4. The character will no longer be your assistant, and the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-user-graduate\"></i> icon will disappear.\n5. SillyTavern will revert to using the Default Assistant (see below).\n\n### Interacting with the Assistant\n\nOnce the Welcome Screen is displayed with your chosen assistant, simply type your message into the chat input bar at the bottom of the screen and press Enter or click the send button. This will start a new chat session with your Welcome Page Assistant.\n\nTo open a previous chat with the assistant, use the Recent Chats section or find the chat in the **Manage chat files** dialog (accessible via the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-bars\"></i> Options** menu).\n\n## Default Assistant\n\nSillyTavern will automatically create a default character named \"Assistant\" when you interact with the Welcome Screen for the first time. This character serves as a fallback option if you haven't set a specific character as your Welcome Page Assistant.\n\nThe default assistant doesn't have any specific prompts attached to it, and you're free to customize it as you like (e.g. renaming, adding a picture, or setting a personality).\n\n* If you haven't explicitly set a character as your Welcome Page Assistant, this default assistant will be used.\n* If you unset your chosen assistant, the system will revert to this default assistant.\n* If a character you had set as an assistant is deleted, the system will also revert to the default assistant.\n\n**Note:** You cannot \"unset\" the default system assistant in the same way you unset a character you've chosen. To change from the default assistant, you must set one of your other characters as the assistant."

    "content": "# World Info\n\n**World Info (also known as Lorebooks or Memory Books) is a powerful tool available in ST to insert prompts dynamically into your chat to help guide the AI replies.**\n\nCommonly, World Info (WI for short) is used to  enhance the AI's understanding of the details in your fictional world, however you could use a World Info entry to insert ANYTHING that you would like to insert into the prompt.\n\nIt functions like a dynamic dictionary that only inserts relevant information from World Info entries when keywords associated with the entries are present in the message text.\n\nThe SillyTavern engine activates and seamlessly integrates the appropriate lore into the prompt, providing background information to the AI.\n\n*It is important to note that while World Info helps guide the AI toward the desired content, it does not guarantee its appearance in the generated output messages. That depends on how good your model is at making use of additional information!*\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n* The World Info engine is a very powerful prompt management tool. Don't fixate on adding character lore alone, feel free to experiment.\n* Activation keywords, titles, and other information that is not in the **Content** field is not inserted into context, so each World Info entry should have a comprehensive, standalone description.\n* To create rich and detailed world lore, entries can be interlinked and reference one another by using recursive activation. See more on [Recursion](SillyTavern_Usage.md) below.\n* SillyTavern offers flexible context budgeting for inserted background information. To conserve prompt tokens, it is advisable to keep entry contents concise.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* World Info Encyclopedia (https://rentry.co/world-info-encyclopedia): Exhaustive in-depth guide to World Info and Lorebooks. By kingbri, Alicat, Trappu.\n\n## Character Lore\n\nOptionally, World Info files can be assigned to a character to serve as dedicated lore sources across all chats with that character (including groups).\n\nOne primary World Info can be bound to the character. To do that, navigate to the Character Management panel and click the globe button, then pick World Info from a dropdown list and click \"Ok\". When exporting the character, this file will also get embedded in the character card data.\n\nTo unbind, change, or assign additional World Info files as character lore, shift-click the globe button or click \"More...\" then \"Link World Info\". Note that only the primary World Info file gets exported with the character.\n\n### Character Lore Insertion Strategy\n\nWhen generating an AI reply, entries from the character World Info will be combined with the entries from a global World Info selector using one of the following strategies:\n\n#### Sorted Evenly (default)\n\nAll entries will be sorted according to their Insertion Order as if they a part of one big file, ignoring the source.\n\n#### Character Lore First\n\nEntries from the Character World Info would be included first by their Insertion Order, then entries from the Global World Info.\n\n#### Global Lore First\n\nEntries from the Global World Info Info would be included first by their Insertion Order, then entries from the Character World Info.\n\n### World Info Entry\n\n#### Key\n\nA list of keywords that trigger the activation of a World Info entry. Keys are not case-sensitive by default (this is [configurable](SillyTavern_Usage.md)).\n\n##### Regular Expression (Regex) as Keys\n\nKeys allow a more flexible approach to matching by supporting regex. This makes it possible to match more dynamic content with optional words or characters, spacing, and all the other utilities that regex provides.  \nIf a defined key is a valid regex (Javascript regex style, with `/` as delimiters. All flags are allowed), it will be treated as such when checking whether an entry should be triggered. Multiple regexes can be entered as separate keys and will work alongside each other. Inside a regex, commas are possible. Plaintext keys do not support commas, as they are treated as key separators.  \n\nAn example of a use-case for advanced regex matching:  \nAn entry/instruction that should be inserted, when char is doing a weather-related action\n\n```js\n/(?:{{char}}|he|she) (?:is talking about|is noticing|is checking whether|observes) (?:the )?(rainy weather|heavy wind|it is going to rain|cloudy sky)/i\n```\n\nFor more information on Regex syntax and possibilities: Regular expressions - JavaScript | MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions)\n\n###### Advanced Regex Per-Message Matching\n\nST prefixes every chat message in the WI scan buffer with `character name:` and after v1.12.6, concatenates prepends them using the character value 1 (`\\x01`).  \nThis means you can match specific input or output from a certain character using a regex tied to that separation character.\n\nFor example, to match only the user saying \"hello\", you could use the following regex:\n\n```js\n/\\x01{{user}}:[^\\x01]*?hello/\n```\n\n##### Key Input\n\nThere are two modes to enter keywords, each with a slightly different UI. In \u2328\ufe0f *plaintext mode* (default), keys can be entered as a comma-separated list in a single text field. Regexes can be included too, but they don't have any special highlighting. In \u2728 *fancy mode*, the keys appear as separate elements and regexes will be highlighted as such. The control supports editing and deleting keys. The mode can be switched via the inline button inside the input control.\n\n#### Optional Filter\n\nComma-separated list of additional keywords in conjunction with the primary key.\nIf no arguments are provided, this flag is ignored.\nSupports logic for AND ANY, NOT ANY, or NOT ALL\n\n1. AND ANY = Activates the entry only if the primary key and Any one of the optional filter keys are in scanned context.\n2. AND ALL = Activates the entry only if the primary key and ALL of the optional filter keys are present.\n3. NOT ANY = Activates the entry only if the primary key and None of the optional filter keys are in scanned context.\n4. NOT ALL = Prevents activation of the entry despite primary key trigger, if all of the optional filters are in scanned context.\n\nThese keys also support [regex](SillyTavern_Usage.md).\n\n#### Entry Content\n\nThe text that is inserted into the prompt upon entry activation.\n\n#### Insertion Order\n\nNumeric value. Defines a priority of the entry if multiple were activated at once. Entries with larger order numbers will be inserted closer to the end of the context as they will have more impact on the output. For example, an entry with Order number 100 will appear in the context before an entry with Order number 250.\n\n#### Insertion Position\n\n* **Before Char Defs:** World Info entry is inserted before the character's description and scenario. Has a moderate impact on the conversation.\n* **After Char Defs:** World Info entry is inserted after the character's description and scenario. Has a greater impact on the conversation.\n* **Before Example Messages:** The World Info entry is parsed as an example dialogue block and inserted before the examples provided by the character card.\n* **After Example Messages:** The World Info entry is parsed as an example dialogue block and inserted after the examples provided by the character card.\n* **Top of AN:** World Info entry is inserted at the top of Author's Note content. Has a variable impact depending on the Author's Note position.\n* **Bottom of AN:** World Info entry is inserted at the bottom of Author's Note content. Has a variable impact depending on the Author's Note position.\n* **@ D:** World Info entry is inserted at a specific depth in the chat (Depth 0 being the bottom of the prompt).\n  * \u2699\ufe0f - as a system role message\n  * \ud83d\udc64 - as a user role message\n  * \ud83e\udd16 - as an assistant role message\n* **Outlet:** World Info entry is not injected automatically. Instead, its content is stored under a named outlet so you can decide exactly where it appears in the prompt by calling it with the [`{{outlet::Name}}` macro](SillyTavern_Usage.md).\n\nExample Message entries will be formatted according to the prompt-building settings: Instruct Mode or Chat Completion prompt manager. They also follow the Example Messages Behavior rules: being gradually pushed out on full context, always kept, or disabled altogether.\n\nIf your Author's Note is disabled (Insertion Frequency = 0), World Info entries in A/N positions will be ignored!\n\n#### Outlet Name\n\nWhen the **Outlet** insertion position is selected, an additional **Outlet Name** field becomes available for the entry. The name that you provide here groups entries together and defines the token that you will use to pull them into the prompt manually.\n\nUse the `{{outlet::YourName}}` macro in the [Prompt Manager](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_prompt-manager.md) or [Advanced Formatting](SillyTavern_Usage_Prompts_advancedformatting.md) prompt fields. When the prompt is built, the macro is replaced with the combined content of every World Info entry that shares the same outlet name, separated by newlines, sorted by their [Insertion Order](SillyTavern_Usage.md) value.\n\nIf an outlet entry is missing a name it will be skipped during generation, so make sure to fill in the field. Outlet names support autocomplete based on the names you have already used to make it easy to reuse consistent labels.\n\n##### Limitations and caveats\n\n* Placing outlet macros inside World Info entries is not supported and will not work. This conflicts with the evaluation order of World Info and may lead to infinite loops.\n* Nesting outlets is not supported. You cannot place an outlet macro inside another outlet's content. Same as above, this may lead to infinite loops.\n* Character card fields (Description, Personality, Scenario, etc.) cannot expand outlets. Those fields are parsed early so they can act as [additional matching sources](SillyTavern_Usage.md) for World Info triggers, which means outlets are not available when their text is processed. Use another macro-aware field if you need to place outlet content in the prompt body instead.\n* The Author's Note editor also cannot resolve outlets. To place outlet content around the Author's Note, assign the entries to **Top of AN** or **Bottom of AN** insertion positions instead of relying on the macro.\n* Outlet names are case-sensitive. The `{{outlet::}}` macro must use exactly the same capitalization as the entry's **Outlet Name**, otherwise no content is returned.\n* Leading or trailing spaces in an outlet name are ignored when you call the macro, so names saved with extra whitespace will not match. Avoid padding names so they can be resolved correctly.\n* Outlet macros that have no content assigned to them will be replaced with an empty string.\n\n#### Entry Title / Memo\n\nA text field for your convenience to label your entries, which is not utilized by the AI or any of the trigger logics.\n\nIf empty, can be backfilled using the entries' first key by clicking on the \"Fill empty memos\" button.\n\n#### Strategy\n\n1. \ud83d\udd35 (Blue Circle) = The entry would always be present in the prompt.\n2. \ud83d\udfe2 (Green Circle) = The entry will be triggered only in the presence of the keyword.\n3. \ud83d\udd17 (Chain Link) = The entry is allowed to be inserted by embedding similarity.\n\nEach Entry also has a toggle that allows you to enable or disable the entry.\n\n#### Probability (Trigger %)\n\nThis value acts like an additional filter that adds a chance for the entry NOT to be inserted when it is activated by any means (constant, primary key, recursion).\n\n1. Probability = 100 means that the entry will be inserted on every activation.\n2. Probability = 50 means that the entry will be inserted with a 1:1 chance.\n3. Probability = 0 means that the entry will NOT be inserted (essentially disabling it).\n\nUse this to create random events in your chats. For example, every message could have a 1% chance of waking up an Elder God if its name is mentioned in the message.\n\n#### Inclusion Group\n\nInclusion groups control how entries are selected when multiple entries with the same group label are triggered simultaneously. If multiple entries having the same group label were activated, only one will be inserted into the prompt.\n\nBy default, the chosen entry is selected randomly based on their Group Weight (default is 100 points) \u2014 the higher the number, the higher the probability of selection. This allows for a random selection among the triggered entries, adding an element of surprise and variety to interactions.\n\nA single entry can be part of multiple inclusion groups if they are defined as a comma-separated list. The same logic as explained above will apply. If that entry is triggered, it will *disable* all other entries that are part of any of its groups. Therefore, if any of the groups are activated, this entry will not be activated.\n\n#### Prioritize Inclusion\n\nTo provide more control over which entries are activated via [Inclusion Group](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md), you can use the 'Prioritize Inclusion' setting. This option allows you to specify deterministically which entry to choose instead of randomly rolling Group Weight chances.\n\nIf multiple entries having the same group label and this setting turned on were activated, the one with the highest 'Order' value will be selected. This is useful for creating fallback sequences via inclusion groups. For example to prioritize low-depth entries with more emphasis, or to choose a specific instruction on setting the scene over another if both are valid.\n\n#### Use Group Scoring\n\nWhen this setting is enabled globally or per entry, the number of activated entry keys determines the group winner selection. Only the subset of a group with the highest number of key matches will be left to be activated by Group Weight or Inclusion Priority - the rest will be deactivated and removed from the group.\n\nUse this to give more specificity for individual entries in large groups. For example, they can have a common key and a specific key. A random entry will be inserted when a specific key is not provided, and vice versa.\n\nThe score calculation logic for primary keys is 1 match = 1 point.\n\nFor secondary keys, the interaction depends on the chosen Selective Logic:\n\n1. AND ANY: 1 secondary match = 1 point.\n2. AND ALL: 1 point for every secondary key if they all match.\n3. NOT ANY and NOT ALL: no change.\n\nExample:\n\n* Entry 1. Keys: song, sing, Black Cat. Group: songs\n* Entry 2. Keys: song, sing, Ghosts. Group: songs\n\nThe input `sing me a song` can activate either entry (both activated 2 keys), but `sing me a song about Ghosts` will activate only Entry 2 (activated 3 keys).\n\n#### Automation ID\n\nAllows to integrate World Info entries with [STscripts](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md) from Quick Replies extension. If both the quick reply command and the WI entry have the same Automation ID, the command will be executed automatically when the entry with a matching ID is activated.\n\nAutomations are executed in the order they are triggered, adhering to your designated sorting strategy, combining the [Character Lore Insertion Strategy](SillyTavern_Usage.md) with the 'Priority' sorting. Which leads to [Blue Circle](SillyTavern_Usage.md) entries processed first, followed by others in their specified 'Order'. Recursively triggered entries will be processed after in the same order.\n\nThe script command will run only once if multiple entries with the same Automation ID are activated.\n\n#### Character Filter\n\nA list of character names for which this entry can be activated. If this list is not empty, the entry will only be activated for characters whose names are on the list. When a tag is selected, the entry will only be activated for characters that have that specific tag.\n\n\"Exclude\" mode inverts the filter, meaning that the entry will be activated for all characters except those that are added to the list or that have the selected tag(s).\n\n#### Triggers\n\nThe generation types for which this World Info entry can be activated. If nothing is selected, the entry can be activated for all generation types. If one or more are selected, the entry will only be activated for those specific generation types:\n\n* **Normal:** Regular message generation request.\n* **Continue:** When the Continue button is pressed.\n* **Impersonate:** When the Impersonate button is pressed.\n* **Swipe:** When the generation is triggered by swiping.\n* **Regenerate:** When the Regenerate button is pressed in solo chats.\n* **Quiet:** Background generation requests, usually triggered by [extensions](SillyTavern_extensions_index.md) or [STscript](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md) commands.\n\n**The \"Regenerate\" trigger is not available in group chats as it uses different regeneration logic: all messages from the last reply are deleted, and messages are queued using the \"Normal\" generation type according to the chosen [Group reply strategy](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_groupchats.md).**\n\n**#### Additional matching sources**\n\nBy default World Info Entries are matched only against content from the current conversation. These options allow you to match the entry against different character information that does not show up in the chat, or even persona information. This is useful when you want to have a wide range of entries that are to be used between several characters but don't want to have to manage large lists of tags, or don't want to have to update character filter lists every time you create a new one. This also allows you to match entries based on the persona you have active.\n\n* **Character Description**: Matches against the character description.\n* **Character Personality**: Matches against the character personality summary, found under Advanced Definitions.\n* **Scenario**: Matches against the character specified scenario, found under Advanced Definitions.\n* **Persona Description**: Matches against the current selected persona's description.\n* **Character's Note**: Matches against the character's note, which can be found under Advanced Definitions.\n* **Creator's Notes**: Matches against the character creator's notes, which can be found under Advanced Definitions. The creator's notes are usually not included in the prompt.\n\n## Vector Storage Matching\n\nThe Vector Storage extension provides an alternative to keyword matching by using the similarity between the recent chat messages and World Info entry contents.\n\nTo enable and use this, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n\n1. Vector Storage extension is enabled and is configured to use one of the available embedding sources.\n2. The \"Enable for World Info\" checkbox is ticked in the Vector Storage extension settings.\n3. Either the World Info entries that are allowed for keyless matching have the \"Vectorized\" (\ud83d\udd17) status or the \"Enabled for all entries\" option is checked in the Vector Storage settings.\n\nThe choice of the vectorization model in the extension and the theoretical meaning behind the term \"embeddings\" won't be covered here. Check out the [Data Bank](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_data-bank.md) guide if you require more info on this topic.\n\nVector Storage matching adheres to this set of rules:\n\n* The maximum number of entries that are allowed to be matched with the Vector Storage can be adjusted with the \"Max Entries\" setting. This number only sets the limit and does not influence the token budget set in the activation settings for World Info. All of the budgeting rules still apply.\n* This feature only replaces the check for keywords. All additional checks must be met for the entry to be inserted: trigger%, character filters, inclusion groups, etc.\n* The \"Scan Depth\" setting from Activation Settings or entry overrides is not used. The Vector Storage \"Query messages\" value is utilized instead to get the text to match against. This allows for a configuration like \"Scan Depth\" set to 0, so no regular keyword matches will be made, but entries still can be activated by vectors.\n* A \"Vectorized\" status is only an additional marker. The entry would still behave like a normal, enabled, non-constant record that will be activated by keywords if they are set. Remove the keywords if you want them to be activated only by vectors.\n\n**Note**\n\nSince the retrieval quality depends entirely on the outputs of the embedding model, it's impossible to predict exactly what entries will be inserted. If you want deterministic and predictable results, stick to keyword matching.\n\n**## Timed Effects**\n\nUsually, World Info evaluation is stateless, meaning that the result of the evaluation is the same, only depending on the current chat context. However, with the introduction of Timed Effects, you can create entries that have an activation delay, stay active after being triggered, or can't be triggered after the activation.\n\n### Timed Effects Rules\n\n1. The time frames for the effects are measured in messages (not pairs of messages/exchanges), with 0 meaning there is no effect.\n2. Effects only apply in the chat where the entry was activated. Branches inherit the state of the parent chat.\n3. Active timed effects are removed if the chat doesn't advance, e.g. if the last message was swiped or deleted.\n4. Making any changes to the entry that is currently on timed effect will cause the effect to be forcibly removed.\n5. Consequent triggering of keywords does not refresh the effect duration if it's already active.\n\n### Types of Timed Effects\n\n1. Sticky - the entry stays active for N messages after being activated. Stickied entries ignore probability checks on consequent scans until they expire.\n2. Cooldown - the entry can't be activated for N messages after being activated. Can be used together with sticky: the entry goes on cooldown when the sticky duration ends.\n3. Delay - the entry can't be activated unless there are at least N messages in the chat at the moment of evaluation.\n    * Delay = 0 -> The entry can be activated at any time.\n    * Delay = 1 -> The entry can't be activated if the chat is empty (no greeting).\n    * Delay = 2 -> The entry can't be activated if there is zero or only one message in the chat, etc.\n\n### Timed Effects Example\n\nEntry configuration: sticky = 3, cooldown = 2, delay = 2.\n\n```txt\nMessage 0: delay\nMessage 1: entry activated\nMessage 2: sticky\nMessage 3: sticky\nMessage 4: sticky\nMessage 5: cooldown\nMessage 6: cooldown\nMessage 7: entry can be activated again\n```\n\n## Activation Settings\n\nCollapsible menu at the top of the World Info screen.\n\n### Scan Depth\n\n> Can be overridden on an entry level.\n\nDefines how many messages in the chat history should be scanned for World Info keys.\n\n* If set to 0, then only recursed entries and Author's Note are evaluated.\n* If set to 1, then SillyTavern only scans the last message.\n* 2 = two last messages, etc.\n\n### Include Names\n\nDefines if the names of the chat participants should be included in the scanned text buffer as message prefixes. This allows activating entries that use names as keywords without directly mentioning the names in messages.\n\nSee an example of the text to be scanned below, assuming the chat participants are named Alice and Bob.\n\nEnabled (default):\n\n```txt\nAlice: Hello! Good to see you.\nBob: How is the weather today?\n```\n\nDisabled:\n\n```txt\nHello! Good to see you.\nHow is the weather today?\n```\n\n### Context % / Budget\n\n**Defines how many tokens could be used by World Info entries at once.**\nYou can define a threshold relative to your API's max-context settings (Context %) or an objective token threshold (Budget)\n\nIf the budget is exhausted, then no more entries are activated even if the keys are present in the prompt.\n\nConstant entries will be inserted first. Then entries with larger order numbers.\n\nEntries inserted by directly mentioning their keys have higher priority than those that were mentioned in other entries' contents.\n\n### Min Activations\n\n**This setting is mutually exclusive with Max Recursion Steps.**\n\nMinimum Activations: If set to a non-zero value, this will disregard the limitation of \"scan-depth\", seeking all of the chat log backward from the latest message for keywords until as many entries as specified in min activations have been triggered. This will still be limited by the Max Depth setting or your overall Budget cap.\n\n*Additional scan sweeps triggered by Min Activations will not check entries added by recursion on previous steps. Only chat messages and extension prompts can trigger these additional activations. However, the entries activated by Min Activations can trigger other entries as usual.*\n\n### Max Depth\n\nMaximum Depth to scan for when using the Min Activations setting.\n\n### Recursive scanning\n\nRecursive scanning allows for entries to activate other entries or be activated by others, enabling complex interactions and dependencies between different World Info entries. This feature can significantly enhance the dynamic nature of your creative scenarios.  \nWhether recursive scanning is enabled can be controlled with the global setting **Recursive Scan**.  \nThere are three options available to control recursion for each entry:\n\n8 **Non-recursable**: When this checkbox is selected, the entry will not be activated by other entries. This is useful for static information that should not change or be influenced by other world info entries.\n  \n* **Prevent further recursion**: Selecting this option ensures that once this entry is activated, it will not trigger any other entries. This is helpful to avoid unintended chains of activations.\n\n* **Delay until recursion**: This entry will only be activated during recursive checks, meaning it won't be triggered in the initial pass but can be activated by other entries that have recursion enabled. Now, with the added **Recursion Level** for those delays, entries are grouped by levels. Initially, only the first level (smallest number) will match. Once no matches are found, the next level becomes eligible for matching, repeating the process until all levels are checked. This allows for more control over how and when deeper layers of information are revealed during recursion, especially in combination with criteria as NOT ANY or NOT ALL combination of key matches.\n\n**Entries can activate other entries by mentioning their keywords in the content text.**\n\nFor example, if your World Info contains two entries:\n\n```txt\nEntry #1\nKeyword: Bessie\nContent: Bessie is a cow and is friends with Rufus.\n```\n\n```txt\nEntry #2\nKeyword: Rufus\nContent: Rufus is a dog.\n```\n\n**Both** of them will be pulled into the context if the message text mentions **just Bessie**.\n\n### Max Recursion Steps\n\n**This setting is mutually exclusive with Min Activations.**\n\nWhen set to zero, recursion nesting is only limited by your prompt budget. When set to a non-zero value, limits the total number of scan sweeps to desired maximum \"nesting level\".\n\nExample values:\n\n* 1 effectively disables recursion as the check stops after the first step.\n* 2 can only activate recursive entries once.\n* 3 can trigger recursion twice...\n\n### Case-sensitive keys\n\n> Can be overridden on an entry level.\n\n**To get pulled into the context, entry keys need to match the case as they are defined in the World Info entry.**\n\nThis is useful when your keys are common words or parts of common words.\n\nFor example, when this setting is active, keys 'rose' and 'Rose' will be treated differently, depending on the inputs.\n\n### Match whole words\n\n> Can be overridden on an entry level.\n\nEntries with keys containing only one word will be matched only if the entire word is present in the search text. Enabled by default.\n\nFor example, if the setting is enabled and the entry key is \"king\", then text such as \"long live the king\" would be matched, but \"it's not to my liking\" wouldn't.\n\n**Important:** this setting can have a detrimental effect when used with languages that don't use whitespace to separate words (e.g. Japanese or Chinese). If you write entries in these languages, it is advised to keep it off.\n\n### Alert on overflow\n\nShows an alert if the activated World Info exceeds the allocated token budget."

Please refer to the default config.yaml (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/default/config.yaml) in your installation for the most up-to-date list of settings.\n\n**WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THE DEFAULT CONFIG DIRECTLY. THIS WON'T HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECT. EDIT ITS COPY IN THE REPOSITORY ROOT INSTEAD.**\n\n**`config.yaml` is the main configuration file for the SillyTavern server which you can find in the repository root directory after [completing the installation](SillyTavern_Installation_index.md). It is a YAML file that contains various settings, such as network, security, and backend-specific options. **The changes made to this file will take effect after restarting the server.****\n\nNew settings that are added upstream are automatically populated with default values when you run `npm install` (specifically, the `post-install.js` script) after [updating the repository](SillyTavern_Installation_Updating_index.md). You can then modify these settings as needed.\n\nFor nested settings, dot notation is used to indicate the hierarchy. For example, `protocol.ipv6: false` refers to the `ipv6` setting under the `protocol` section with a value of `false`.\n\n```yaml\nprotocol:\n  ipv6: false\n```\n\n## Command-Line Arguments\n\nYou can pass command-line arguments when starting the SillyTavern server to override some settings in [config.yaml](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md).\n\n### Examples\n\n```shell\nnode server.js --port 8000 --listen false\n# or\nnpm run start -- --port 8000 --listen false\n# or (Windows only)\nStart.bat --port 8000 --listen false\n```\n\n### Supported arguments\n\nNone of the arguments are required.

For example, the `dataRoot` setting can be overridden with the `SILLYTAVERN_DATAROOT` environment variable.\n\nThe nested settings should be separated by underscores. For example, `protocol.ipv6` can be overridden with the `SILLYTAVERN_PROTOCOL_IPV6` environment variable.\n\nConfigurations that expect arrays or objects should be JSON-stringified. For example, to override the `whitelist` setting with the `SILLYTAVERN_WHITELIST` environment variable, you should set it as a JSON string: `SILLYTAVERN_WHITELIST='[\"127.0.0.1\", \"::1\"]'`.\n\n**If you are using Node.js v20 or later, you can also store environment variables in a `.env` file and pass it to the server with the `--env-file` flag. For example, to use the `.env` file located in the repository root, you can start the server with the following command:**\n\n```bash\nnode --env-file=.env server.js\n```\n\nAlternatively, pass the environment variables directly via the command line:\n\n```bash\nSILLYTAVERN_LISTEN=true SILLYTAVERN_PORT=8000 node server.js\n```\n\nSee more about using environment variables in the Node.js documentation (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs).\n\n## Data Configuration\n\n| Setting | Description | Default | Permitted Values |\n|---------|-------------|---------|-----------------|\n| `dataRoot` | Root directory for user data storage (standalone mode only) | `./data` | Any valid directory path |\n| `skipContentCheck` | Skip checks for new default content | `false` | `true`, `false` |\n| `enableDownloadableTokenizers` | Enable on-demand tokenizer downloads | `true` | `true`, `false` |\n\n## Logging Configuration\n\n| Setting | Description | Default | Permitted Values |\n|---------|-------------|---------|------------------|\n| `logging.minLogLevel` | Minimum log level to display in the terminal | `0` (DEBUG) | (DEBUG = 0, INFO = 1, WARN = 2, ERROR = 3) |\n| `logging.enableAccessLog` | Write server access logs to a file and the console | `true` | `true`, `false` |\n\n## [Network Configuration](SillyTavern_Administration_remote-connections.md)\n\n| Setting | Description | Default | Permitted Values |\n|---------|-------------|---------|-----------------|\n| `listen` | Enable listening for incoming connections | `false` | `true`, `false` |\n| `port` | Server listening port | `8000` | Any valid port number (1-65535) |\n| `protocol.ipv4` | Enable listening on the IPv4 protocol | `true` | `true`, `false`, `auto` |\n| `protocol.ipv6` | Enable listening on the IPv6 protocol | `false` | `true`, `false`, `auto` |\n| `listenAddress.ipv4` | Listen on a specific IPv4 address | `0.0.0.0` | Valid IPv4 address |\n| `listenAddress.ipv6` | Listen on a specific IPv6 address | `'[::]'` | Valid IPv6 address |\n| `dnsPreferIPv6` | Prefer IPv6 for DNS resolution | `false` | `true`, `false` |\n\n## SSL Configuration\n\n| Setting | Description | Default | Permitted Values |\n|---------|-------------|---------|------------------|\n| `ssl.enabled` | Enable SSL/TLS encryption and HTTPS protocol | `false` | `true`, `false` |\n| `ssl.keyPath` | Path to SSL private key (relative to the server directory) | `\"./certs/privkey.pem\"` | Valid file path |\n| `ssl.certPath` | Path to SSL certificate (relative to the server directory) | `\"./certs/cert.pem\"` | Valid file path |\n| `ssl.keyPassphrase` | Passphrase for the SSL private key.

    "content": "# Administration\n\nDespite following many security best practices, the SillyTavern server is not secure enough for exposure to the public internet.\n\n**NEVER HOST ANY INSTANCES ON THE OPEN INTERNET WITHOUT ENSURING PROPER SECURITY MEASURES FIRST.**\n\n**WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DUE TO IMPROPER OR INADEQUATE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION.**\n\n**:::callout**\n\n**[config.yaml](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md)**\n\nThe main configuration file for SillyTavern. It contains various settings, such as network, security, and backend-specific options.\n\n**:::callout**\n\n**[Multi-user](SillyTavern_Administration_multi-user.md)**\n\nTo share your SillyTavern instance with others, you can create multiple user accounts. Each user has their own settings, extensions, and data. User accounts can also be password-protected.\n\n**:::callout**\n\n**[Remote access](SillyTavern_Administration_remote-connections.md)**\n\nYou can access your SillyTavern instance from your phone, tablet, or another computer.\n\n**:::callout**\n\n**[VPNs and Tunneling](SillyTavern_Administration_tunneling.md)**\n\nTo access your SillyTavern instance from the internet, you can use a VPN or a tunneling service like Cloudflare Zero Trust, ngrok, or Tailscale.\n\n**:::callout**\n\n**[Reverse proxying](SillyTavern_Administration_reverse-proxying.md)**\n\nEnthusiasts can set up a reverse proxy to access their SillyTavern instance from the internet.\n\n**## Security checklist**\n\n**These are just recommendations. Please consult a web application security specialist before making your ST instance live.**\n\n1. Keep your operating system and runtime software, such as Node.js, up to date. This ensures your system has the latest security patches and fixes, which helps prevent potential vulnerabilities.\n2. Use a [whitelist](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md) and a network firewall. Only allow trusted IP ranges to access the server.\n3. Enable [basic authentication](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md). It acts as a \"master password\" before you can access the front-end app.\n4. Alternatively, configure external authentication. Some known services for this are Authelia (https://www.authelia.com/) and authentik (https://goauthentik.io/). See the [SSO guide](SillyTavern_Administration_sso.md) for details.\n5. Never leave admin accounts without passwords. The server will warn you on startup if you have any unprotected admin accounts.\n6. Use the discreet login setting outside the local network. This hides the user list from potential outsiders.\n7. Check the access logs often. They are written to the server console and to the `access.log` file and provide information about incoming connections, such as IP address and user agent.\n8. Configure HTTPS. For a localhost server, you can generate and use a self-signed certificate. Otherwise, you may need to deploy a reverse-proxy web server such as Traefik (https://traefik.io/) or Caddy (https://caddyserver.com/docs/getting-started).\n9. Configure and enable [host whitelisting](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md), especially if you're not using HTTPS encryption on a local network.\n\nFind more information about secure proxying in the following guide: [Reverse Proxying SillyTavern](SillyTavern_Administration_reverse-proxying.md)."

    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/administration/multi-user",
    "content": "Multi-user mode allows several people to use one SillyTavern server. Each user has their own settings, extensions, and data. User accounts can also be password-protected.\n\nUser passwords provide basic privacy between users of a multi-user setup. They are not a security feature and should not be considered as such. All user data (including chat history, API keys, and other sensitive information) is stored in plain text on the server. It can be viewed and modified by anyone with access to the server's filesystem. **Do not use SillyTavern on a public server or with untrusted users.**\n\n**## Configuration**\n\nTo enable and use the multi-user mode, edit the `config.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\n# Enable multi-user mode\nenableUserAccounts: true\n# Enable discreet login mode: hides user list on the login screen\nenableDiscreetLogin: true\n```\n\n1. When the user account setting is disabled, a `default-user` fallback admin account is utilized for storing the user data.\n2. When the discreet login setting is disabled, a list of active users is displayed on the login screen. If enabled, a user must enter their handle manually.\n\nYou can't _delete_ the `default-user` account from the users list because it is used for serving the user data in case if `enableUserAccounts` is set to `false`. But you can _disable_ it to hide it from the list and disallow logins.\n\n**## User handles**\n\nA handle is the unique identifier of a user. It can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.\n\nA path to the user data directory assumes using the following pattern: `%DATA_ROOT%/%USER_HANDLE%`.\n\nExamples of valid user handles:\n\n- default-user\n- juan555\n- flux-the-cat\n- cool-guy1337\n\n## Roles\n\n- **Admin** - can manage (create, delete, modify) other users. Can install extensions for all users.\n- **User** - can't manage other users. Can install extensions only for themselves.\n\nExcept for having admin panel access, both user roles are functionally identical and can use a full range of SillyTavern features without any restrictions. An implementation of user permissions is TBD.\n\nAll user accounts are created as regular users first, and then could be promoted to admins if needed.\n\n### Login screen\n\nThere you can select a user account to use. Has two styles, depending on the `enableDiscreetLogin` config value.\n\nThe login screen is bypassed and not displayed when you have only one active user and it is not password protected.\n\n### User profile\n\nYou can access an account self-management menu using an \"Account\" button under the \"User settings\" panel in the top menu bar.\n\n1. Display name - used in the login screen, can be changed. Does not correlate with personas and is not visible for the AI APIs - you can still use as many personas as you want.\n2. Profile picture - used in the login screen. You can either use a custom picture, the default persona picture (if set), or the last used persona otherwise.\n3. Password - a lock icon reflects the account protection status (open lock = no password). A password can be set, changed, or removed using the \"Change Password\" button.\n4. Settings Snapshots - access and review the backups of your `settings.json` file, with the ability to create or restore snapshots.\n5. Download Backup - download an archive of your user data folder.\n6. Reset Settings - reset factory default settings, while leaving other data (character, chats) intact.\n\n## Password recovery\n\n1. A password can be recovered from a login screen. You need access to the server console to get a one-time recovery code (consisting of 4 digits).\n2. Alternatively, you can use a utility script in the SillyTavern server to reset a password by providing the user handle.\n\n```txt\nUsage: node recover.js [account] (password)\nExample: node recover.js admin SecurePassword\n```\n\n## Content scaffolding\n\nTo add custom content for users, you can use the content scaffolding feature. This feature allows you to define a set of files that will be copied to each user's data directory when the server starts up.\n\nYou must create an `index.json` file in the `/default/scaffold` directory for this feature to work. The syntax is the same as for default content. All file paths should be relative to the `/default/scaffold` directory, and you can organize files using subdirectories.\n\nScaffolded files are copied before default files, which means they will override any default files (presets/settings/etc.) that have the same file name.\n\nEvery user data directory has a `content.log` file that lists all files copied from the scaffold and default directories. Remove this file to force the server to sync the content again on the next restart.\n\n**### Recognized content types**\n\n| Type                          | Value                |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| settings.json                 | `'settings'`         |\n| Character card                | `'character'`        |\n| Character sprites             | `'sprites'`          |\n| Background image              | `'background'`       |\n| World Info file               | `'world'`            |\n| Persona avatar                | `'avatar'`           |\n| UI theme                      | `'theme'`            |\n| ComfyUI workflow              | `'workflow'`         |\n| KoboldAI Classic preset       | `'kobold_preset'`    |\n| Chat Completion preset        | `'openai_preset'`    |\n| NovelAI preset                | `'novel_preset'`     |\n| Text Completion preset        | `'textgen_preset'`   |\n| Instruct Mode template        | `'instruct'`         |\n| Context Formatting template   | `'context'`          |\n| MovingUI preset               | `'moving_ui'`        |\n| Quick Replies set             | `'quick_replies'`    |\n| System Prompt template        | `'sysprompt'`        |\n| Reasoning Formatting template | `'reasoning'`        |\n\n### Example (`/default/scaffold/index.json`)\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"filename\": \"themes/Midnight.json\",\n        \"type\": \"theme\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"filename\": \"backgrounds/city.png\",\n        \"type\": \"background\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"filename\": \"characters/Charlie.png\",\n        \"type\": \"character\"\n    }\n]\n```"

    "content": "# Remote connections\n\nMost often this is for people who want to use SillyTavern on their mobile phones while their PC runs the ST server within the same WiFi network.\n\nIt is also the first step for allowing remote connections from outside the local network.\n\nYou should not use port forwarding to expose your ST server to the internet. Instead, use a VPN or a tunneling service like Cloudflare Zero Trust, ngrok, or Tailscale. See the [VPN and Tunneling](SillyTavern_Administration_tunneling.md) guide for more information.\n\n**!!!danger Disclaimer**\n\n**NEVER HOST ANY INSTANCES TO THE OPEN INTERNET WITHOUT ENSURING PROPER SECURITY MEASURES FIRST.**\n\n**WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSSES IN CASES OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DUE TO IMPROPER OR INADEQUATE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION.**\n\n**## Allowing remote connections**\n\nBy default, the ST server only accepts connections from the machine that it's running on (localhost). To allow it to listen for connections from other devices, set the `listen` option in `config.yaml` to `true`.\n\n**If you search for `config.yaml` directly in the SillyTavern folder, you may find two files.**\n\nAll modifications to `config.yaml` in this document refer to the one in the SillyTavern root directory (/SillyTavern/config.yaml), not `/SillyTavern/default/config.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\n\n# Listen for incoming connections\nlisten: true\n```\n\nWhen ST is listening for remote connections, you should see this message in the console:\n\n```txt\nSillyTavern is listening on IPv4: 0.0.0.0:8000\n```\n\nand some explanation about what that means.\n\nWhen ST is **not** listening for remote connections, you should see this message in the console:\n\n```txt\nSillyTavern is listening on IPv4: 127.0.0.1:8000\n```\n\n## Access control configuration\n\nAfter enabling remote connection listening, you must configure at least one access control method. Otherwise, the server will not start.\n\n### Whitelist-Based access control\n\nTo enable access control via a whitelist, edit the `config.yaml` file in the SillyTavern root directory (`/SillyTavern/config.yaml`):\n\n1. Start SillyTavern at least once to generate the necessary configuration files.\n2. Open `/SillyTavern/config.yaml` in a text editor.\n3. Find the `whitelist` section and add the IP addresses you wish to allow:\n    * List each IP address separately.\n    * Ensure `127.0.0.1` is included, or you will be unable to connect from the host machine.\n    * Supports individual IPs, CIDR masks (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`), and wildcard (`*`) ranges.\n4. Save the `config.yaml` file.\n5. **Restart your SillyTavern server.**\n\n#### Example `config.yaml` whitelist configuration\n\n1. Allow any device on the local network:\n\n    ```yaml\n    whitelist:\n      - ::1\n      - 127.0.0.1\n      - 10.0.0.0/8\n      - 172.16.0.0/12\n      - 192.168.0.0/16\n    ```\n\n    If unsure about your local network's address range, use the whitelist above.\n\n2. Allows two specific devices to connect:\n\n    ```yaml\n    whitelist:\n      - ::1\n      - 127.0.0.1\n      - 192.168.0.2\n      - 192.168.0.5\n    ```\n\n3. Allows any device on the `192.168.0.*` subnet to connect:\n\n    ```yaml\n    whitelist:\n      - ::1\n      - 127.0.0.1\n      - 192.168.0.*\n    ```\n\n4. Allow network connections for all IPv4 devices:\n\n    ```yaml\n    whitelist:\n      - 0.0.0.0/0\n    ```\n\n### Disabling whitelist-based access control\n\nTo disable access control via a whitelist:\n\n* Set `whitelistMode` to `false` in `/SillyTavern/config.yaml`.\n* Remove or rename `whitelist.txt` (if it exists) in the SillyTavern base installation folder.\n* Restart your SillyTavern server.\n\n### Not recommended: using `whitelist.txt`\n\nIf `whitelist.txt` exists, it takes precedence over the whitelist settings in `config.yaml`.\n\nHowever, since all other configurations are managed within `config.yaml`, and `whitelist.txt` may encounter permission issues or become locked, the system could silently revert to using the `config.yaml` whitelist.\n\n**Editing config.yaml directly is both simpler and more reliable.**\n\n**If you still prefer using whitelist.txt:**\n\n1. Create a new text file named `whitelist.txt` in the SillyTavern base installation folder.\n2. Open it in a text editor and add the allowed IP addresses.\n3. Save the file and restart your SillyTavern server.\n\n#### Example `whitelist.txt` configuration\n\n```txt\n10.0.0.0/8\n172.16.0.0/12\n192.168.0.0/16\n127.0.0.1\n::1\n```\n\nThis allows any device on the local network to connect.\n\n### Access control by HTTP Basic Authentication\n\nHTTP Basic Authentication does not provide strong security.\n\nThere is no rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. If this is a concern, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy with TLS and rate-limiting, and a dedicated [authentication service](SillyTavern_Administration_sso.md).\n\n**The server will ask for username and password whenever a client connects via HTTP. **This only works if the Remote connections (listen: true) are enabled.****\n\nTo enable HTTP BA, Open `config.yaml` in the SillyTavern base directory and search for `basicAuthMode` Set basicAuthMode to true and set username and password. Note: `config.yaml` will only exist if ST has been executed before at least once.\n\n```yaml\nbasicAuthMode: true\nbasicAuthUser:\n  username: \"MyUsername\"\n  password: \"MyPassword\"\n```\n\nAlternatively you can enable basic auth as follows:\n\n```yaml\nbasicAuthMode: true\nenableUserAccounts: true\nperUserBasicAuth: true\n```\n\nIn this `perUserBasicAuth` mode the basic auth's username and password will be the same as any valid multi user account that has a password. Additionally SillyTavern will login directly to that account. **Ensure you have an account with a password prior to enabling `perUserBasicAuth`.**\n\nSave the file and restart SillyTavern if it was already running. You should be prompted for username and password when connecting to your ST. Both username and password are transmitted in plain text. If you are concerned about this, you can serve ST via HTTPS.\n\n### Host whitelisting\n\nWhen hosting a server over the network without HTTPS, it is highly recommended to enable request host verification. This helps prevent various attacks, such as DNS rebinding. By default, the SillyTavern server will log a console message on a first connection from an unrecognized host.\n\n### Toggle host whitelisting\n\nTo enable host whitelisting, edit the `config.yaml` file in the SillyTavern root directory:\n\n```yaml\nhostWhitelist:\n    enabled: true\n```\n\n### Add trusted hosts\n\nTo add a host name to a list of trusted hosts, include it in the `hostWhitelist.hosts` section:\n\n**Tips**\n\nDo not add `localhost` or IPs (such as `127.0.0.1` or `::1`). These are always considered trusted.\n\nTo add a range of hosts, use a leading dot. For example, adding `.trycloudflare.com` will trust `trycloudflare.com` as well as any subdomain like `example.trycloudflare.com`.\n\n```yaml\n\nhostWhitelist:\n  hosts:\n    - \"example.com\"\n    - \".trycloudflare.com\"\n```\n\n### Toggle console messages\n\nTo disable console messages for unrecognized hosts, set the `hostWhitelist.scan` option to `false`:\n\n```yaml\nhostWhitelist:\n    scan: false\n```\n\n## Connecting to your SillyTavern instance\n\n### Getting the IP address for the ST host machine\n\nAfter the whitelist has been setup, you'll need the IP of the ST-hosting device.\n\nIf the ST-hosting device is on the same wifi network, you will use the ST-host's internal wifi IP:\n\n* For Windows: windows button > type `cmd.exe` in the search bar > type `ipconfig` in the console, hit Enter > look for `IPv4` listing.\n\nIf you (or someone else) wants to connect to your hosted ST while not being on the same network, you will need the public IP of your ST-hosting device.\n\n* While using the ST-hosting device, access this page (https://whatismyipaddress.com/) and look for for `IPv4`. This is what you would use to connect from the remote device.\n\n### Connecting to the ST server\n\nWhatever IP you ended up with for your situation, you will put that IP address and port number into the remote device's web browser.\n\nA typical address for an ST host on the same wifi network would look like:\n\n`http://192.168.0.5:8000`\n\nUse http:// NOT https://\n\n### Connection logging\n\nNew connections to the server are displayed in the console window and logged in the `access.log` file in the SillyTavern data directory.\n\nA console message for a browser on the same machine as the server looks like:\n\n```txt\nNew connection from 127.0.0.1; User Agent: ...\n```\n\nA console message for a browser on a different machine on the same network as the server might look like:\n\n```txt\nNew connection from 192.168.116.187; User Agent: ...\n```\n\nIf a connection is refused, the console message will look like:\n\n```txt\nNew connection from 192.168.116.211; User Agent: ...\n\nForbidden: Connection attempt from 192.168.116.211. If you are attempting to connect, \nplease add your IP address in whitelist or disable whitelist mode in config.yaml in \nroot of SillyTavern folder.\n```\n\n`access.log` will contain the connection information, with timestamps, but not whether the connection was accepted or refused.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nStill unable to connect?\n\n* If the connection attempt [appears in the console](SillyTavern_Administration.md), but is forbidden, it is a [whitelist issue](SillyTavern_Administration.md).\n* If ST is listening for remote connections but the connection attempt does not appear in the console, it is a [network issue](SillyTavern_Administration.md).\n* If ST is not listening for remote connections, it is a [reading issue](SillyTavern_Administration.md).\n\n#### Network issues\n\n* On Windows, the application may be blocked by the application firewall. The quickest way to fix this is to uninstall and reinstall node.js, and when prompted by the firewall, allow it to access the network. Otherwise, you will need to manually allow the node.js application through the Windows application firewall.\n* On Windows 11, enable the Private Network profile type in Settings > Network and Internet > Ethernet. This is VERY important for Windows 11, otherwise, you would be unable to connect even with the aforementioned firewall rules.\n* On Linux, you may need to allow the port through the firewall. The command to do this is `sudo ufw allow 8000`. This will allow traffic on port 8000.\n\nDo not modify the port forwarding settings on your router. This is not necessary for accessing ST within your local network, and can expose your server to the internet.\n\nIf you are trying to access your ST server from [outside your local network](SillyTavern_Administration_remote-connections.md), and it's not working, identify whether the problem is between the remote device and the tunnel/VPN endpoint, or between the tunnel endpoint on the server and the ST service. Otherwise you will spend a lot of time troubleshooting the wrong thing.\n\n## HTTPS\n\n### Start SillyTavern with TLS/SSL\n\nSSL can also be configured using the `config.yaml` file: [SSL Configuration](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md).\n\n**To encrypt traffic from and to your ST instance, start the server with the `--ssl` flag.**\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js --ssl\n```\n\nAs per default, ST will search for your certificates inside the `certs` folder. If your files are located elsewhere, you can use the `--keyPath` and `--certPath` arguments.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nnode server.js --ssl --keyPath /home/user/certificates/privkey.pem --certPath /home/user/certificates/cert.pem\n```\n\nThe user you're running SillyTavern with requires read permissions on the certificate files.\n\n### How to get a certificate\n\nThe simplest, quickest way to get a certificate is by using certbot (https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/).\n\n### Certificates in Docker\n\nFor security and privacy reasons, do not include your SSL certificates inside the Docker image if you are building one. Instead, use volume mounts to provide the certificates at runtime.\n\n**When running SillyTavern in Docker, the recommended way to provide SSL certificates is by placing them in the `/config` volume mount. This allows you to manage certificates without rebuilding the container image.**\n\n1. Place your certificate files (e.g., `privkey.pem` and `cert.pem`) in your local config directory that is mounted to `/config` in the container.\n\n2. Update your `config.yaml` to reference the certificates:\n\n    ```yaml\n    ssl:\n      enabled: true\n      certPath: ./config/cert.pem\n      keyPath: ./config/privkey.pem\n    ```\n\n3. Restart your Docker container to apply the changes."

Return back to the `docker` folder.\n    ```sh\n    cd /docker\n    ```\n12. Using `nano` or a similar editor, create a file name _docker-compose.yaml_ and paste the following. Save the file afterwards.\n\n    ```yaml\n    secrets:\n        CF_DNS_API_KEY:\n            file: ./secrets/cloudflare/CF_DNS_API_KEY\n\n    services:\n        traefik:\n            image: traefik:latest\n            container_name: traefik\n            restart: unless-stopped\n            secrets:\n                - CF_DNS_API_KEY\n            ports:\n                - 80:80\n                - 443:443\n                - 8080:8080\n            environment:\n                CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/CF_DNS_API_KEY\n                CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/CF_DNS_API_KEY\n            volumes:\n                - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\n                - ./appdata/traefik/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro\n                - ./appdata/traefik/config.yml:/config.yml:ro\n                - ./appdata/traefik/acme.json:/acme.json\n                - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro\n\n    networks:\n        internal:\n            driver: bridge\n    ```\n\n13. Login to Cloudflare and click on your Domain, followed by **Get your API token**.\n14. Click on _Create Token_ then _Create Custom Token_ and make sure you give your token the following permissions.\n\n**Token Permissions**\n\n    **Zone -> DNS -> Edit**\n\n    **Zone -> Zone -> Read**\n\n**Click on _Continue to summary_ followed by _Create Token._**\n\n15. Copy the Token Key given to you and store it somewhere secure.\n16. `cd` into `secrets/cloudflare` and using `nano` or a similar editor, create a file named **CF_DNS_API_KEY** and paste your key inside.\n17. Return to your domain page and go to **DNS**. Create a new record using **Add record** and create two _A_ type keys like the ones below. Replace `PUBLIC_IP` with your own public IP, then click _Save_.\n\n    | Type | Name (required) | Target (required) | Proxy Status | TTL  |\n    |------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|------|\n    | A    | DOMAIN.com      | PUBLIC_IP         | Proxied      | Auto |\n    | A    | www             | PUBLIC_IP         | Proxied      | Auto |\n\n18. Create another record of the **`CNAME`** type, then click _Save_. Here is an example on how it should appear on the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\n    | Type  | Name (required) | Target (required) | Proxy Status | TTL |\n    |-------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----|\n    | CNAME | silly           | DOMAIN.com        | Proxied      | N/A |\n\n19. `cd` into _appdata/traefik_ and using `nano` or a similar editor, create a file name _config.yml_ and paste the following. Replace `PRIVATE_IP` with the private IP you obtained, and `silly.DOMAIN.com` with the name of your subdomain and domain page, then save the file.\n\n    ```yml\n    http:\n        routers:\n            sillytavern:\n                entryPoints:\n                    - \"https\"\n                rule: \"Host(`silly.DOMAIN.com`)\"\n                middlewares:\n                    - https-redirectscheme\n                tls: {}\n                service: sillytavern\n\n        services:\n            sillytavern:\n                loadBalancer:\n                    servers:\n                        - url: \"http://PRIVATE_IP:8000\"\n                    passHostHeader: true\n\n        middlewares:\n            https-redirectscheme:\n                redirectScheme:\n                    scheme: https\n                    permanent: true\n    ```\n\n20. Run Docker Compose using the following commands:\n    ```sh\n    cd /docker\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n21. Go to your SillyTavern folder and edit `config.yaml` to enable listen mode and basic authentication, whilst disabling `whitelistMode`.\n\n    ```yaml\n    listen: yes\n    whitelistMode: false\n    basicAuthMode: true\n    ```\n\n**Tip**\n\n    Make sure to change the default username and password to something strong that you can remember.\n\n**Or to use the SillyTavern accounts as usernames and passwords:**\n\n    ```yaml\n    basicAuthMode: true\n    enableUserAccounts: true\n    perUserBasicAuth: true\n    ```\n\n**Tip**\n\n    Before enabling perUserBasicAuth ensure you have a valid multi-user setup with working passwords.\n\n**22. Wait a few minutes, then open your domain page you made for ST. At the end of it, you should be able to open SillyTavern from anywhere you go just with one URL and one account.**\n\n**Tip**\n\n    If nothing happens after several minutes, check the container logs for Traefik for any possible errors.\n\n**23. Enjoy! :D**\n\n### Linux (Docker SillyTavern)\n\n**Note**\n\nDo note that we run SillyTavern on bare-metal over Docker. This is a rough idea of what we would do on Docker with other Docker containers we tend to use with ST.\n\n**1. Follow Steps 1-11 of **Linux (Bare-Metal SillyTavern)**.**\n\n2. Login to Cloudflare and click on your Domain, followed by **Get your API token**.\n3. Click on _Create Token_ then _Create Custom Token_ and make sure you give your token the following permissions.\n\n**Token Permissions**\n\n   **Zone -> DNS -> Edit**\n\n    **Zone -> Zone -> Read**\n\n**Click on _Continue to summary_ followed by _Create Token._**\n\n4. Copy the Token Key given to you and store it somewhere secure.\n5. `cd` into `secrets/cloudflare` and using `nano` or a similar editor, create a file named **CF_DNS_API_KEY** and paste your key inside.\n6. Return to your domain page and go to **DNS**. Create a new record using **Add record** and create two _A_ type keys like the ones below. Replace `PUBLIC_IP` with your own public IP and the example domain with your domain, then click _Save_.\n\n    | Type | Name (required) | Target (required) | Proxy Status | TTL  |\n    |------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|------|\n    | A    | DOMAIN.com      | PUBLIC_IP         | Proxied      | Auto |\n    | A    | www             | PUBLIC_IP         | Proxied      | Auto |\n\n7. Create another record of the **`CNAME`** type, then click _Save_. Here is an example on how it should appear on the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\n    | Type  | Name (required) | Target (required) | Proxy Status | TTL |\n    |-------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----|\n    | CNAME | silly           | DOMAIN.com        | Proxied      | N/A |\n\n8. Git clone SillyTavern into the `docker` folder.\n    ```sh\n    cd /docker && git clone https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern\n    ```\n9. Using `nano` or a similar editor, create a file name _docker-compose.yaml_ and paste the following. Replace `silly.DOMAIN.com` with the subdomain you added above, the save the file afterwards.\n\n    ```yaml\n    secrets:\n        CF_DNS_API_KEY:\n            file: ./secrets/cloudflare/CF_DNS_API_KEY\n\n    services:\n        traefik:\n            image: traefik:latest\n            container_name: traefik\n            restart: unless-stopped\n            secrets:\n                - CF_DNS_API_KEY\n            ports:\n                - \"80:80\"\n                - 443:443\n                - 8080:8080\n            environment:\n                CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/CF_DNS_API_KEY\n                CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/CF_DNS_API_KEY\n            volumes:\n                - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\n                - ./appdata/traefik/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro\n                - ./appdata/traefik/config.yml:/config.yml:ro\n                - ./appdata/traefik/acme.json:/acme.json\n                - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro\n        sillytavern:\n            build: ./SillyTavern\n            container_name: sillytavern\n            hostname: sillytavern\n            image: ghcr.io/sillytavern/sillytavern:latest\n            volumes:\n                - \"./appdata/sillytavern/config:/home/node/app/config\"\n                - \"./appdata/sillytavern/data:/home/node/app/data\"\n            restart: unless-stopped\n            labels:\n                - \"traefik.enable=true\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern.entrypoints=http\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern.rule=Host(`silly.DOMAIN.com`)\"\n                - \"traefik.http.middlewares.sillytavern-https-redirect.redirectscheme.scheme=https\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern.middlewares=sillytavern-https-redirect\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern-secure.entrypoints=https\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern-secure.rule=Host(`silly.DOMAIN.com`)\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern-secure.tls=true\"\n                - \"traefik.http.routers.sillytavern-secure.service=sillytavern\"\n                - \"traefik.http.services.sillytavern.loadbalancer.server.port=8000\"\n\n    networks:\n        internal:\n            driver: bridge\n    ```\n\n10. Run Docker Compose using the following commands:\n    ```sh\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n11. Stop the SillyTavern Docker container.\n    ```sh\n    docker compose stop sillytavern\n    ```\n12. Go to your SillyTavern folder (`appdata/sillytavern/config`) and edit `config.yaml` to enable listen mode and basic authentication, whilst disabling `whitelistMode`.\n\n    ```yaml\n    listen: yes\n    whitelistMode: false\n    basicAuthMode: true\n    ```\n\n**Tip**\n\n    Make sure to change the default username and password to something strong that you can remember.\n\n**13. Start the SillyTavern Docker container again.**\n\n    ```sh\n    docker compose up -d sillytavern\n    ```\n14. Wait a few minutes, then open your domain page you made for ST. At the end of it, you should be able to open SillyTavern from anywhere you go just with one URL and one account.\n\n**Tip**\n\n    If nothing happens after several minutes, check the container logs for Traefik for any possible errors.\n\n**15. Enjoy! :D**\n\n## Updating your Cloudflare DNS\n\n**DDClient** (https://ddclient.net/) allows you to sync your public IP to Cloudflare in the situation that your ISP changes it, allowing you to continue accessing your ST instance as if nothing ever happened."

    "content": "# Single Sign-On (SSO)\n\nSSO allows you to create users and secure many different pages using a login portal presented on sites you want to secure. While it is complex to setup, it is a good way to both learn SSO and secure your ST instance out on the internet more.\n\nSSO can also replace [HTTP Basic Authentication](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md) as an access control mechanism for [remote connections](SillyTavern_Administration_remote-connections.md).\n\nThis is recommended because SSO provides better security and functionality than HTTP Basic Authentication.\n\n**Authelia** (https://www.authelia.com/) and **Authentik** (https://goauthentik.io/) are open-source SSO providers that can be used with SillyTavern.\n\n## Sign in with SSO\n\nIf your SSO-provided username **exactly** matches the user handle of a SillyTavern user account, you can sign in to SillyTavern as that user by SSO.

    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/administration/tunneling",
    "content": "VPNs and tunnels are a secure way to access your home network from anywhere in the world. This guide will show you how to use a VPN or a tunnel to access your SillyTavern instance from anywhere.\n\n## Methods\n\n1. Use a **home-made VPN**.\n\n   Several routers come with the ability to host a VPN server (primarily OpenVPN or WireGuard) in the router administration page. Refer to your router's manual to setup a VPN and add your devices to the VPN. Once connected, just go to the private IP you have set for SillyTavern and you can connect just fine. Easier for users and for Windows use.\n\n2. Use **Cloudflare Zero Trust** (https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/).\n\n   Cloudflare Zero Trust is a free organizational feature in Cloudflare that allows you to add 50 users. This will proxy your traffic through Cloudflare and by adding your ST PC as a tunnel using `cloudflared`, you can connect to your ST instance as if you were home.\n\n   Do note that after making a tunnel, you will have to add a route to your router's private IP addresses and calculate IP CIDR values to have full local access on the go using Cloudflare Zero Trust.\n\n3. Use a standalone **Cloudflare** or **ngrok (https://ngrok.com)** tunnel.\n\n   Similar to how AI backends can connect, you can also connect your ST instance via a Cloudflare Tunnel and open the Cloudflare Tunnel page. However, you will have to copy and paste each new link generated by Cloudflare/NGROK each time you want to use ST on-the-go.\n\n4. Use **Tailscale**.\n\n   Tailscale is a VPN provider enabling a secure remote connection to your PC.\n\n## Tailscale setup\n\nTailscale is a VPN provider enabling a secure remote connection to your PC. An open-source implementation of the Tailscale server exists and you can also host the server using Headscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale), but that is outside of the scope of this tutorial.\n\n### 1. Creating an account\n\n* Go to Tailscale's website (https://tailscale.com/) and create a new account.\n\n**NOTE:** For everyday use by a single person Tailscale will be permanently free. If you fear hidden costs, just don't add any payment options.\n\n### 2. Setting up clients\n\n* Go to Tailscale's download page (https://tailscale.com/download) and download the client/app on the device you have SillyTavern running on and on the device you want to use from a remote location.\n* Log in on both devices with your previously created account.\n* Go to Tailscale's admin page (https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) and approve both devices.\n* Take note of both of the connected devices' names.\n\n### 3. Adding your devices to the whitelist\n\n* Add your connecting device's machine name (the one you want to use SillyTavern with) to SillyTavern's whitelist by following [Managing whitelisted IPs](SillyTavern_Administration_remote-connections.md).\n\n### 4. Connecting\n\nNow whenever you want to use SillyTavern from anywhere all you have to do is:\n\n* Have Tailscale turned on on both the PC hosting SillyTavern and your device that wants to use it remotely.\n* Open a browser on the device that wants to connect and go to `http://<machine name of PC running st>:8000/`\n\n### 5. Sharing SillyTavern instance with a friend (optional)\n\n* Tell your friend to create their own Tailscale account and download the client on their device.\n* Go to Tailscale's admin page (https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).\n* Hover over the three-dot button on your PC hosting SillyTavern and press \"Share...\" or press the three-dot button and press \"Sharing settings...\".\n* Uncheck \"Allow use as an exit node\" (unless you want your friend to be able to route all their internet traffic through your PC).\n* Either send the link as an email or change the tab to \"Copy share link\", press the big blue button with the same text, and send it to your friend in any other way.\n* After clicking your share link, your friend will see your PC pop up in their Tailscale network.\n* Send your friend the same link you use to access SillyTavern as explained in the last step.\n\n**NOTE:** This will give your friend full access to any services running locally on your PC like SillyTavern, automatic1111, etc. Only do this if you truly trust your friend."

The default prompt is \"What's in this image?\"\n- **Ask every time**: Toggle to request a custom prompt for each image caption\n\n### Message Template\n- **Message Template**: Customize the caption message template. Use `{{caption}}` macro to insert the generated caption. The default template is `[{{user}} sends {{char}} a picture that contains: {{caption}}]`\n\n### Auto-captioning\n- **Automatically caption images**: Toggle to enable automatic captioning of images pasted or attached to messages\n- **Edit captions before saving**: Toggle to allow editing captions before they are saved\n\n## Captioning images\n\nAll the ways to caption images in SillyTavern:\n\n* Choose \"**Generate Caption**\" from the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-magic-wand-sparkles\"></i> Extensions** popup menu and select an image file when prompted\n* Click the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-envelope-open-text\"></i> **Caption** icon at the top of an image already in a message\n* Paste an image directly into the chat input with [auto-captioning](SillyTavern_extensions.md) enabled\n* Attach an image file to a message using the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-paperclip\"></i> **Embed File or Image** button in the actions of a message.\n* Send a message with an embedded image\n* Use the `/caption` [slash command](SillyTavern_extensions.md)\n\n## Auto-Captioning\nThe auto-captioning feature allows you to automatically generate captions for images as they are added to the chat, without manually triggering the captioning process each time.\n\nTo enable, select the \"Automatically caption images\" checkbox in the Image Captioning panel. You can also choose to edit captions before they are saved by checking the \"Edit captions before saving\" box.\n\nOnce enabled, auto-captioning will trigger in the following scenarios:\n\n- When an image is pasted directly into the chat input.\n- When an image file is attached to a message.\n- When a message with an embedded image is sent.\n\nThe system will use your selected captioning source (Local, Extras, Horde, or Multimodal) and the configured settings to generate a caption for the image.\n\n### Editing captions before saving (Refine Mode)\n\nIf you've enabled the \"Edit captions before saving\" option:\n1. After an image is added, a popup will appear with the generated caption.\n2. You can review and edit the caption as needed.\n3. Click \"OK\" to apply the caption, or \"Cancel\" to discard the caption without saving.\n\n### Caption sending\nThe generated (and optionally edited) caption will be automatically inserted into the prompt using the Message Template you've configured. By default, it will be sent in this format:\n\n```\n[BaronVonUser sends Seraphina a picture that contains: ...]\n```\n\n## Slash Command: /caption\nThe extension provides a `/caption` slash command to use in the chatbox or in scripts. \n\n### Usage\n\n```\n/caption [quiet=true|false]? [mesId=number]? [prompt]\n```\n\n- `prompt` (optional): A custom prompt for the captioning model. Only supported by multimodal sources.\n- `quiet=true|false`: If set to true, suppresses sending a captioned message to the chat. Default is false.\n- `mesId=number`: Specifies a message ID to caption an image from an existing message instead of uploading a new one.\n\nIf no `mesId` is provided, the command will prompt you to upload an image. When `quiet` is false (default), a new message with the captioned image will be sent to the chat. The generated caption can be used as input for other commands.\n\n### Examples\nCaption a new image with the default settings:\n\n```\n/caption\n```\n\nCaption a new image with a custom prompt:\n\n```\n/caption Describe the main colours and shapes in this image\n```\n\nCaption an image from message #5 without sending a new message:\n\n```\n/caption mesId=5 quiet=true\n```\n\nCaption an image from message #10 with a custom prompt then [generate a new image](SillyTavern_extensions_Stable-Diffusion.md) based on the caption:\n\n```\n/caption mesId=10 Describe this image using comma-separated keywords | /imagine \n```\n\n## Local source\n\nYou can change the model in [config.yaml](SillyTavern_Administration_config-yaml.md). The key is called `extensions.models.captioning`. Enter the Hugging Face model ID you want to use. The default is `Xenova/vit-gpt2-image-captioning`. \n\nYou can use any model that supports image captioning (`VisionEncoderDecoderModel` or \"image-to-text\" pipeline). The model needs be to compatible with the transformers.js library. That is, it needs ONNX weights. Look for models with the `ONNX` and `image-to-text` tags, or that have a folder called `onnx` full of `.onnx` files. \n\n## Multimodal source\n\n### General configuration\n\n- **Model**: Choose the model for image captioning. Options vary based on the selected API.\n- **Allow reverse proxy**: Toggle to allow using a reverse proxy if defined and valid (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, xAI)\n\nAPI keys and endpoint URLs for captioning sources are managed in the [API Connections](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_index.md) panel. Set the connection up in API Connections first, then select it as your captions source in Captioning.\n\n**Set it up in the API Connections panel first**\n\nOne last time: configure the API key/address/port in **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-plug\"></i> API Connections** and use the connection in Captioning.\n\nYou can still use Claude for chats and Google AI Studio for image captioning, or whatever. Just set them *both* up in the 'API Connections' tab first. Then flip your Chat Completion source to Claude and your Captioning source to Google AI Studio.\n\n**For most local backends, you will need to set some options in the model backend rather than in SillyTavern. If your backend can only run one model at a time and doesn't support automatic switching, you have several options to use different models for chat and captioning:**\n\n1. **Secondary endpoints:** Use the secondary endpoint feature (see [Secondary endpoints](SillyTavern_extensions.md) section below) to connect to a different API server for captioning\n2. **Multiple connection types:** Connect to your backend using both Text Completion and Chat Completion modes in API Connections - this gives you two separate connections to the same backend type\n\n### Sources\n\nTo use one of these caption sources, select Multimodal in the Source dropdown.\n\n* \"I want the best captioning possible, and I don't mind paying for it\": Anthropic\n* \"I don't want to pay anything or run anything\": Google

The extension will handle that automatically.\n\n**This is only supported by the following APIs:**\n\n- KoboldCpp\n- llama.cpp\n- Ollama\n- Text Generation WebUI (oobabooga)\n- vLLM\n\n### Source-specific guides\n\n#### KoboldCpp\n\nFor general information on installing and using KoboldCpp (https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), see the KoboldCpp documentation (https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/wiki).\n\nTo use KoboldCpp for multimodal captioning:\n\n* get a multimodal-capable model, trained to process text and image prompts at the same time.\n* also get the multimodal projections for the model. These weights allow the model to understand how the text and image parts of the input relate to each other.\n* load the model and projections in the KoboldCpp launch GUI or command line interface.\n\nThe original and classic local multimodal model is LLaVA. GGUF-format files for the model and projections are available from Mozilla/llava-v1.5-7b-llamafile (https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/llava-v1.5-7b-llamafile). To load them from the command line, set the model and projections with the `--model` and `--mmproj` flags. For example:\n\n```shell\n./koboldcpp \\\n--model=\"models/llava-v1.5-7b-Q4_K.gguf\" \\\n--mmproj=\"models/ llava-v1.5-7b-mmproj-Q4_0.gguf\" \\\n... other flags ...\n```\n\nSome LLaVA finetunes you can try: xtuner/llava-llama-3-8b-v1_1-gguf (https://huggingface.co/xtuner/llava-llama-3-8b-v1_1-gguf), xtuner/llava-phi-3-mini-gguf (https://huggingface.co/xtuner/llava-phi-3-mini-gguf).\n\nYou can use multimodal projections for the base model that your particular finetune was built from. Projections for some common base models are available from koboldcpp/mmproj (https://huggingface.co/koboldcpp/mmproj/tree/main)."

    "content": "# Chat Vectorization\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe use of this extension does not guarantee a better chatting experience or improved memory of any sort. Only use if you understand all the implications of vector database utilization.\n\n**Chat vectorization searches for messages in your current chat history that seem relevant to your most recent messages.**\n\nIt temporarily shuffles the most relevant messages to the beginning or end of the chat history. \nThis happens when the model's reply to your last message is generated.\n\nThe messages at the start and end of the chat history tend to have the greatest impact on the model's reply. \nTherefore, shuffling relevant messages to these locations can help the model focus on relevant information in its reply. \n\nIn particular, chat vectorization can find relevant messages that are too far back in the message history to fit \ninto the request context. Shuffling these messages into context provides the model with information that it would not have otherwise.\n\nChat vectorization is a kind of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Retrieval-augmented generation increases the \nquality of responses generated by a model, by providing additional relevant information in the prompt.\n\n* Retrieval: the most recent messages are used to retrieve relevant past messages\n* Augmented: the model's context is augmented by inserting past messages in a useful way\n* Generation: the model is instructed to use the past messages when generating the response\n\n**Some terms:**\n\nA *vector* is a set of numbers that could represent the themes, content, style, or other characteristics of a piece of text. \n\n*Vectorization* is calculating the vector that represents a piece of text. This is done by a vectorizing model.\nJust as text generation models make text from text, vectorizing models make vectors from text.\n\n*Vector search* finds relevant results by comparing vectors rather than, say, keywords. If we calculate the vector \nfor a search query, we can compare it to the stored vectors for a collection of pieces of text. This finds the texts \nin our collection that are most similar to the text in the search query. In the case of chat vectorization, the \n\"search query\" is the most recent 2 messages, and the \"texts in our collection\" are all the other messages in the chat.\n\n**## Setting up**\n\n**Prompt Caching Compatibility**\n\nLike any dynamic prompt source (World Info, Summarization, etc.), Chat Vectorization restructures the prompt prefix between the LLM calls, which can lead to frequent cache misses. When used with caching, vectorization is often counter-productive, as the modified prompts rarely hit the cache \u2013 effectively making caching useless. You have to choose one or the other, but not both.\n\n**To enable Chat vectorization, select \"Extensions\" > \"Vector Storage\" > \"Enabled for chat messages\".**\n\nConfigure a vectorization source and vectorization model. Chat vectorization uses the same vector source as Data Bank, \nso you may have set this up already. The settings for the Vectorization Source and Vectorization Model are documented in [Data Bank](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_data-bank.md).\n\nChat vectorization uses the same vector storage as Data Bank, but this does not need to be set up or configured. \nThere is also information about Vector Storage in [Data Bank](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_data-bank.md).\n\nChat vectorization does not use Data Bank to store the chat messages. The messages are stored in the chat. \n\n## Preparing chat messages for search (vector storage)\n\nSo that chat messages can be searched, a vector is calculated for each message and stored.\n\nVectorizing occurs in the background, whenever you send or receive a message.\n\nEach message is stored individually, so that it can be found and shuffled individually during generation.\n\nLarge messages are split into \"chunks\" so that the model can be given the most relevant part of a long message. The chunk size is 400 characters. \nYou can change this with \"Chunk size (chars)\". \n\nMessages are divided into chunks by finding a chunk boundary such as a paragraph break, line break, or space between words. This is so that \nthe all the chunks make sense, as far as possible. If your chat messages have some other way to mark natural splitting points, such as `----`, \nyou can add this to \"Chunk boundary\". The setting for \"Chunk boundary\" is shared with Data Bank.\n\n### Vector storage controls\n\nTo calculate vectors for all messages in the current chat, without waiting for them to be processed in the background, choose \"Vectorize All\" from the settings.\n\nTo see how many messages in the current chat have been vectorized, choose \"View Stats\". This displays the total number of vectors stored. \nIt also indicates the specific chat messages that have been vectorized, by marking them with a green ball.\n\nTo remove all the vectors for messages in the current chat, choose \"Purge Vectors\".\n\n**The controls for \"Vectorize All\" and \"Purge Vectors\" **within Chat vectorization** only affect the stored vectors for the current chat.**\n\nHowever, there are identical buttons in File vectorization that affect the vectors for files in Data Bank. Ensure that you are purging the vectors that you intend to purge.\n\n**## Finding relevant messages to shuffle (vector retrieval)**\n\nTo find the most relevant messages in the chat history, the most recent messages are converted (vectorized) into a query vector. By default, the 2 most recent messages are used. To change this, change the value of \"Query messages\". This value is also used when finding relevant content from Data Bank. \n\nPast messages must have a relevance score of at least 25% to be included. You can change this with \"Score threshold\". The setting for score threshold is shared with Data Bank.\n\nThe 3 most relevant messages from chat history are shuffled. You can change this with \"Insert#\".\n\nTo avoid disturbing the most recent events in the chat, the 5 most recent messages are not shuffled. To change this, change the value of \"Retain#\".\n\n## Shuffling messages (augmented generation)\n\nThe messages are shuffled to one of 3 places:\n\n* The top of the chat, after the Main Prompt / Story String (the default)\n* The top of the chat and *before* the Main Prompt / Story String\n* The end of the chat, before the last 2 messages (\"In-chat @ Depth 2\"). Since you just sent a message, this position is usually just before the previous reply from the model.\n\nYou can change this with \"Injection Position\" and \"Depth\".\n\nThe messages are included in order of relevance, with more relevant messages shown after less relevant messages.\n\nThe name of the person or character who sent each message is included. \n\nThe messages are shown to the model as \"past events\". This assists the model to understand that the messages contain information from a different point in the chat history than the point at which they are inserted. You can change this with \"Injection Template\".\n\nYou can see the final prompt to the model using the Prompt Itemization popup, the terminal logs, or the browser console logs. The browser console logs are useful for understanding what all the steps in Chat vectorization are doing.\n\n## Vector summarization\n\n**Warning**\n\nThe Vector summarization feature is experimental.\n\n**Vector summarization does not create summaries of your chat. It does not turn the retrieved messages into summaries. It does not make your chat history shorter. It is not \"like [Summarize](SillyTavern_extensions_Summarize.md) but better\".**\n\n**Vector summarization is intended to make vector search of chat messages more effective. It does this by introducing a summarizing step prior to vectorizing. The summarizing step extracts the most important parts of the message, so that the resulting vector is a better indicator of what the message relates to.**\n\nVector summarization may make vector search less effective. \n\nTo summarize the messages in the chat history, and generate a vector for each summarized message, choose \"Summarize chat messages for vector generation\". \n\nThe summarized message does not replace the original message in chat. If a vector search matches the vector of a summarized message, the original message is retrieved from chat history and shuffled into context. The summarized versions of the messages are retained in Vector Storage, which may be of interest for debugging.\n\nTo summarize the content of the messages used to search the chat history (the last 2 messages by default), choose \"Summarize chat messages when sending\".\n\nEach time a message is summarized for vectorising, a separate request is made to the summarizing model. You can choose which summarizing source is used with \"Summarize with\". Choosing \"Main API\" will generate the summaries using the same model and connection settings that you use for generating chat or text completions.\n\nThe request consists of the raw message content and an instruction about how the model should produce the summary. You can change the instruction with \"Summary Prompt\"."

    "content": "# Dynamic Audio\n\nThis guide will walk you through setting up and customizing dynamic audio assets for your SillyTavern experience.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you've met the following prerequisites:\n\n- Make sure you're on the latest version of SillyTavern.\n- Install the \"Dynamic Audio\" extension from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in the Extensions panel (stacked blocks icon).\n\n## Dynamic Audio Setup (Browser)\n\n1. **Connect to the Assets Repository**:\n   - Launch SillyTavern and navigate to **Extensions** > **Assets**.\n   - Click on the \"Connect\" button to establish a connection to the official assets repository.\n   - Download the desired audio assets, such as background music (BGM) or ambient sounds, that correspond to the backgrounds you intend to use.\n\n2. **Enable Dynamic Audio Extension**:\n   - In SillyTavern, go to **Extensions** > **Dynamic Audio**.\n   - Enable the extension, unmute and adjust the volume of BGM and ambient sounds to your preference.\n   - When bgm end another one will play randomly, click on loop button to keep current bgm playing\n   - Click on roll button to pick another bgm randomly\n\n3. **Expression based BGM**:\n   - Enable expression BGM switch if you want bgm to follow character expression (require bgm in character folder see below).\n   - Adjust the cooldown timer (in seconds) between BGM updates. Increase it if you find the BGM changes too frequently in group chats or when using character-specific BGM with emotion detection.\n\n## Importing Music for Characters\n\nTo set up custom music for your characters' emotions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigate to Character Folder**:\n   - Go to the characters folder, e.g., `\\SillyTavern\\data\\<user-handle>\\characters\\Seraphina`.\n\n2. **Create BGM Folder**:\n   - Inside the character folder, create a subfolder named `bgm`.\n\n3. **Import Emotion Music**:\n   - Within the `bgm` folder, import the music files for each emotion. Supported audio extensions include `.mp3`, `.ogg`, and `.wav`.\n   - Naming convention: `[emotion]_[number].mp3`, e.g., `anger_0.mp3`, `joy_0.mp3`.\n\n4. **Multiple Tracks for Emotions**:\n   - You can import multiple tracks for the same emotion by incrementing the number, e.g., `neutral_1.mp3`, `neutral_2.mp3`.\n\n5. **Default Music Selection**:\n   - When no emotion is detected, a random neutral track will play as the default. Emotions are detected similarly to updating sprites; refer to the [expression images documentation](SillyTavern_extensions_Expression-Images.md) for details.\n\n## Changing Default BGM Music\n\nIf a character doesn't have custom BGM in their folder, a default track will play. Here's how you can change it:\n\n1. **Navigate to BGM Folder**:\n   - Go to the following folder: `\\SillyTavern\\data\\<user-handle>\\assets\\bgm`.\n\n2. **Replace/Add Music**:\n   - Replace or add music files (`.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.wav`) to this folder.\n   - These are the official audio assets downloaded using the assets extension.\n   - One of these tracks will play randomly when no character-specific BGM is found (solo or group chat).\n\n## Changing Ambient Sounds\n\nAmbient sounds add depth to your scenes. Here's how you can customize them:\n\n1. **Navigate to Ambient Folder**:\n   - Go to the following folder: `\\SillyTavern\\data\\<user-handle>\\assets\\ambient`.\n\n2. **File Naming Convention**:\n   - Ambient audio filenames correspond to background image filenames, replacing spaces with dashes.\n   - Example: `\"bedroom-clean.mp3\"` corresponds to the \"bedroom clean.jpg\" background.\n   - If the lock button is unlock the audio file corresponding to the background will play. Activating lock will keep current ambient playing.\n\n3. **Custom Ambients**:\n   - You can add your own ambient sounds for custom or existing backgrounds by following the same naming pattern.\n\nThank you for following this guide! Your SillyTavern experience is now enriched with dynamic audio."

    "content": "# EmulatorJS\n\nThis extension allows you to play retro console games right from the SillyTavern chat.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n- Latest release version of SillyTavern.\n- ROM files downloaded from the net. You can find them anywhere (https://archive.org/details/ni-romsets).\n\n**How to install:**\n\n1. Install using SillyTavern's extensions downloader.\n2. Or use this link: `https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-EmulatorJS`\n\n## Usage\n\n- Open the \"EmulatorJS\" extension menu.\n- Click \"Add ROM file\". ROMs are saved to your browser storage and not stored on a server.\n- Select the game file to add. Input the name and core (if it wasn't auto-detected). If the core requires a BIOS file, add it too.\n- Click the \"Play\" button in the list or launch via the wand menu.\n- You can customize controls and other settings in the emulator frame after launching the game.\n- Use save/load state functions if you need to take a break.\n\nCheck the EmulatorJS docs to see the list of available cores and their requirements: Cores (https://emulatorjs.org/docs4devs/cores).\n\n## Comments mode\n\nWith the power of multimodal models, your AI bots can see your gameplay and provide witty in-character comments.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. A browser that supports ImageCapture (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageCapture#browser_compatibility). Tested on desktop Chrome. Firefox requires to enable it with config. Safari won't work.\n2. Chat Completion API with image inlining mode is recommended. Check the API documentation to see if the chosen model supports multimodal prompts.\n3. If image inlining is disabled, make sure that the [Image Captioning](SillyTavern_extensions_captioning.md) extension is enabled, then select the \"Multimodal\" captioning source.\n\n### How to enable comments\n\n1. Make sure you set the interval of providing comments in the EmulatorJS extension settings. This setting defines how often the character is queried for comments using an image of your current gameplay. A value of 0 indicates that no comments are provided.\n2. Select a character chat and launch the game. For the best performance, make sure that the ROM file is properly named so that AI can have more background context.\n3. Start playing as you normally would. The vision model will be queried periodically to write a comment based on the latest screenshot it \"sees\".\n\n### Settings\n\n1. Caption template - a prompt used to describe the in-game screenshot.`{{game}}` and `{{core}}` additional macros are supported.\n2. Comment template - a prompt used to write a comment based on the generated caption. `{{game}}`, `{{core}}`, `{{caption}}` additional macros are supported. For image inlining mode, `{{caption}}` is replaced with `see included image`.\n3. Force captions - will force the use of multimodal captioning even if image inlining is supported and enabled.\n\n### Why I'm not seeing any comments?\n\nComments are temporarily paused (interval step skipped) if:\n\n1. Emulator is paused (with a pause button, not in-game).\n2. The browser window is out of focus.\n3. The user input area is not empty. This is to let you type your reply in peace.\n4. Another reply generation is currently in progress.\n5. TTS voice is being read aloud. Comment is held off (30 seconds maximum) until it finishes, but not skipped.\n6. A character card or group is currently open. Comment mode is disabled when starting the game from a welcome screen.\n\nOther common issues:\n\n1. Make sure you've set a commenting interval before launching the game.\n2. Make sure you have set a multimodal API key and there are no errors in the ST server console.\n\nStill doesn't work? Send us your browser debug console logs (press F12).\n\n## Credits\n\n- EmulatorJS engine (GPLv3): <https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS>"

    "source": "SillyTavern_extensions_Expression-Images.md",
    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/extensions/expression-images",
    "content": "# Character Expressions\n\n## What is it?\n\nExpression images are images (aka 'sprites') of your AI character which are shown next to (or behind) the chat window.\n\nExpression images can automatically change based on a classification, adjusting to the sentiment expressed in the AI's most recent chat response.\n\n## Adding Character Expression Images\n\n1. Open the Extensions Panel and expand the 'Character Expressions' section. If you have the character chat open, you will see a grid of image placeholders.\n\n2. Click the 'Upload image' button at the top left of each image in the grid, and select the image you want to apply to that emotion. This will save the image with the correct filename inside the `/data/<user-handle>/characters/(character_name_here)/` folder.\n3. Repeat this for all expressions you want to assign an image to.\n\n### Importing an Expression images ZIP file\n\nUsing the '<i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-zipper\"></i> Upload sprite pack (ZIP)' button, you can import a zip file that contains a collection of expression images, and those images will automatically be added to the correct folder for your **currently selected character**. The ZIP file must contain all images in a flat structure (no subfolders) and correctly named files. Importing a zip will not automatically rename any images to make them match the emotions.\n\n## Change Expressions Manually\n\n1. Click on any of the uploaded expression images (sprites) to display them near the chat interface (with default UI mode) or at the center of the screen (in Visual Novel mode).\n2. Use the `/expression-set (name)` slash command or matching Quick Reply to set the sprite without opening the extensions menu.\n\n## Change Expressions Automatically\n\nTo automatically set expressions when the character replies, you have multiple options.\nExpressions change per message or at regular intervals when message streaming is enabled.\n\n### How does the classify module work?\n\nThe `classify` module uses a small 'sentiment parsing' model that runs alongside the SillyTavern server. This model takes the new output from the AI and detects what kind of sentiment, or emotion, the text is expressing. While multiple sentiments may be expressed in a single message, the model only picks the most likely one and returns that to the SillyTavern. The frontend extension then displays the image that is associated with that sentiment.\n\n### Setup Instructions (Local)\n\n1. Open the extensions panel and expand the \"Character Expressions\" extension menu.\n2. Select \"Local\" in the classification source dropdown.\n3. This will start a one-time download of the classification model from HuggingFace Hub (about ~100 Mb).\n4. Generate any message to verify that the classification works and the sprite appears. You may also check the server console for debug logs.\n\nLocal classification defaults to 28 possible image labels: Cohee/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-onnx (https://huggingface.co/Cohee/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-onnx)\n\nTo use the 6-option classification model, change the value of `extensions.models.classification` variable in the `config.yaml` file to: Cohee/bert-base-uncased-emotion-onnx (https://huggingface.co/Cohee/bert-base-uncased-emotion-onnx)\n\n### Setup Instructions (with LLM)\n\n1. Connect to any of the supported and properly configured APIs via **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-plug\"></i> API Connections**.\n2. Import the expression images the same way as mentioned above.\n3. Select \"Main API\" in the classification source dropdown.\n4. Optionally, configure the classification instruction prompt.\n5. Generate any message to verify that the classification works and the sprite appears. You may also check the server console for debug logs.\n\n#### Prompt Building Strategies\n\nMain LLM source allows to choose how the classification prompt will be built:\n\n* **Limited Context**: Only the last message and a system instruction prompt are sent.\n* **Full Context**: The entire chat history, including the character card are sent.\n\n### Setup Instructions (WebLLM)\n\n1. Install the official WebLLM extension (https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-WebLLM).\n2. Import the expression images the same way as mentioned above.\n3. Select \"WebLLM\" in the classification source dropdown.\n4. Optionally, configure the classification instruction prompt.\n5. Generate any message to verify that the classification works and the sprite appears. You may also check the server console for debug logs.\n\n### Setup Instructions (with Extras)\n\n> [!WARNING]  \n> Extras is deprecated and may be removed in future updates.\n\n1. Have Extras installed and running with the `classify` module enabled: `python server.py --enable-modules=classify`\n2. Import the expression images the same way as mentioned above.\n3. Select \"Extras\" in the classification source dropdown.\n4. The appropriate expression image will display automatically whenever the AI sends you a response.\n\nExtras API uses a classification model with 6 options by default: nateraw/bert-base-uncased-emotion (https://huggingface.co/nateraw/bert-base-uncased-emotion)\n\nThere is also a model with 28 options: joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-student (https://huggingface.co/joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-student)\n\nTo use this model you need to change your Extras command line to include the following argument (with a space before and after): `--classification-model=joeddav/distilbert-base-uncased-go-emotions-student`\n\n## Custom Expressions\n\nHow to get more expression options than provided by default? You can set up **Custom Expressions** in the extension settings. You can assign any name to Custom Expressions. They will appear in the expression image list and can be assigned images like other expressions. They will have an indicator showing that those are custom.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Both Local and Extras only support a limited list of expressions.\n>\n> If you want Custom Expressions to be displayed, you either need to train a classification model with supported labels (outside the scope of this guide), or you can use LLM or WebLLM as classification source, which both will automatically use all existing expressions - both the default and any custom ones.\n\n## What image formats are supported for Expressions?\n\nAny image format is allowed, including webp and animated gifs.\n\nThe most common format is a PNG file with a transparent background.\n\n## Using Default Expressions\n\nIf you don't have expression images for all expressions of a character, or no images at all, there are multiple options on what to display by default.  \nAll of those can be selected via the dropdown under 'Default / Fallback Expression'.\n\n1. **Choose a Fallback Expression**: If an expression gets chosen where you don't have an image for, the fallback expression gets shown instead. Simply select one of the available expressions from the dropdown.\n2. **[No Fallback]**: When no image exists, show nothing.\n3. **[Default emojis]**: You can use the built-in default expressions which are included with in SillyTavern. These are simple emoji-style images.\n\n## Using Multiple Images per Expression\n\nIt is possible to add multiple images per expression to allow for more variety in displayed expressions.  \nTo enable this, simply toggle **Allow multiple sprites per expression**.  \nYou can now upload more than one image, and any additional images will be displayed with a small marker.\n\nIndividual images can be manually chosen by selecting them with a click, or via `/expression-set type=sprite`, which will list available sprite images, instead of expressions.\n\nWhenever an expression with multiple images gets automatically chosen, one of the existing images will be selected at random.  \nIf you want to force a new image of that expression to be chosen when the same expression gets used multiple times, you can enable **Re-roll if same sprite is used again**.\n\n### Naming Convention for Multiple Images per Expression\n\nIn case of multiple images per expressions, files need to be named a specic way.\nThe files need to start with the name of the expressions, and then followed by a suffix, either separated by a dot or a dash. Examples: `joy.png`, `joy-1.png`, `joy.expressive.png`  \nFile names must follow this format for both direct uploads and ZIP imports.\n\n## Sprite Folder Override\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Display names (not character card filenames) dictate which image set is used\n\nIf you have more than one character with the same display name, they will both use the same set of expression images.\n\nIf you want a different image set to be used for each version of the same-named character, you can use the sprites folder override.  \nFolder overrides can also be used to define different sprite sets (outfits, etc.) of the same character.\n\n### How to set an override\n\n1. Create a folder in the `/data/<user-handle>/characters` with any name and put images there, e.g. `/data/<user-handle>/characters/Boris`.\n2. Open the chat with the character whose sprites you'd like to override.\n3. Enter the name of the override folder into the \"Sprite Folder Override\" input and click \"Submit\".\n4. The Sprites list will reload and the \"Sprite set\" indicator should show the override folder.\n5. Alternatively, you can use the `/costume` slash command to achieve the same result: `/costume Boris`.\n6. By prepending a backslash to the override folder name, it will resolve to a subfolder in the current character sprites folder, e.g. `/costume \\tracksuit` for the character named Boris will resolve to the `/data/<user-handle>/characters/Boris/tracksuit` folder."

    "content": "# Smart Context\n\n## **THIS EXTENSION IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED AND NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE. CONSIDER [CHAT VECTORIZATION](SillyTavern_extensions_Chat-vectorization.md) AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE.**\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe use of this extension does not guarantee a better chatting experience or improved memory of any sort. Only use if you understand all the implications of vector database utilization.\n\n**### What is it?**\n\nSmart Context is a SillyTavern extension that uses the ChromaDB library (https://www.trychroma.com) to give your AI characters access to information that exists outside the normal chat history context limit.\n\n### How is that useful?\n\nIf you have a very long chat, the majority of the contents are outside the usual context window and thus unavailable to the AI when it comes to writing a response.\n\nSmart Context automatically takes the entire history of the chat file and puts it into a vector database. This database is then searched each time you input something new into the chat, and if messages with matching keywords are found, those chat messages are placed into the context so the AI can see them when writing its next reply.\n\n***\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n1. Update SillyTavern to at least version 1.10.6.\n2. Install the \"Smart Context\" extension from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in the Extensions panel (stacked blocks icon).\n3. Install or Update Extras (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-extras) to the latest version. Alternatively, use the Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/colab/GPU.ipynb).\n4. *Local installs only:* Install requirements-complete.txt for Extras (even if you did it once before in a prior install).\n5. Run Extras with the chromadb module enabled: `python server.py --enable-modules=chromadb`\n\n#### Getting an error when installing ChromaDB?\n\n```\nERROR: Could not build wheels for hnswlib, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects\n```\n\nInstalling chromadb package requires one of the following:\n\n- Have Visual C++ build tools installed: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>\n- Installing hnswlib from conda: `conda install -c conda-forge hnswlib`\n\n***\n\n### Configuration\n\nOnce Smart Context is enabled, you should configure it in the SillyTavern UI.\nSmart Context configuration can be done from within the Extensions menu \n\nThere are 4 main concepts to be aware of:\n\n- Chat History Preservation\n- Memory Injection Amount\n- Individual Memory Length\n- Injection Strategy\n\n***\n\n#### SmartContext only starts after 10 mesages are in the chat history\n\n- At the start of a new chat, ChromaDB is inactive.\n- Once the chat has accumulated 10 messages, it will begin recording all messages into the database, and recalling messages as needed.\n\n#### Chat History Preservation ('kept mesages')\n\nBy default, ChromaDB will keep as many recent natural chat history messages as specified in the slider.\nAny messages beyond this amount will be removed from your sent prompt, and if 'memories' exist in the database they will be added in place of the older chat history messages (see Strategy below).\n\n***\n\n#### Memory Injection Amount\n\nThe maximum number of 'memories' Smart Context will insert into the context.\nNot every injection attempt will get this full amount.\nIf you send an input related to 'dogs' and only one other message in the DB is related to dogs, then only 1 item will be inserted.\n\n***\n\n#### Individual Memory Length\n\nThis is the maximum length allowed for each injected 'memory'.\nThis is in **CHARACTERS** (not tokens).\nIf set too small, the memory could be cut off midway.\n\nExample:\n\n`Ross: I like dogs with long fur and fluffy tails. I dislike dogs with short fur and short tails.`\n\nThis database 'memory' is 103 characters long, so you would need to set the slider to at least `103` in order to pull it entirely into the context.\n\nIf the slider is less than 103, the message would be cut off and injected like that.\n\n***\n\n### Injection Strategy\n\n#### Replace oldest history\n\nThis strategy keeps X recent messages, removes all message before that, and replaces them with 'memories'.\n\nAdvantage\n\n- less likely to overflow your context limit\n- memories existing near the top of the context will have less immediate impact on the response while still providing 'background information'.\n\nDisadvantage\n\n- old messages are inserted directly into the chat history with no special demarcation, and usually have no immediate natural relevance to the preserved natural chat history messages. This can confuse less intelligent AI models.\n\n#### Add to Bottom\n\nThis strategy leaves the chat history in its natural state and adds 'memories' **after** it inside a formatted [bracket header].\nThis means the 'kept messages' sliders is effectively disabled.\n\nAdvantage\n\n- does not shorten or alter the current natural chat history\n- 'memories' exist after chat and have a stronger impact on the next AI response\n\nDisadvantage\n\n- because no chat items are being removed/replaced, there is a higher chance you will overflow your context limit.\n- because the memories exist very close to the end of the prompt they can have TOO MUCH effect on the AI's response.\n\n#### Custom Depth\n\nThis strategy leaves the chat history in its natural state and adds 'memories' at the depth you determine within the template you specify.\nThis means the 'kept messages' slider is effectively disabled.\nThe custom injection message should include the `{{memories}}` template word which is where all queried memories will be placed.\n\nAdvantage\n\n- flexibility to experiment with memory placement \n- customizable introductions to memory within context\n\nDisadvantage\n\n- because no chat items are being removed/replaced, there is a higher chance you will overflow your context limit.\n\n#### Use % Strategy\n\nNote: This is not compatible with the 'Add to Bottom' strategy, which does not remove any messages at all.\n\nWhile using the 'Replace Oldest History' strategy, checking this box will enable the slider for selecting a percentage of the in-context chat history to replace with SmartContext memories. It will also disable the two sliders for manually selecting the number of messages.\n\nThis strategy automatically calculates a percentage of the chat history to be replaced with SmartContext memories, instead of a fixed number of messages.\n\nAdvantage\n\n- easier than manually calculating the number of messages yourself\n- adjusts with the available context size, applying the same percentage to small and large prompt spaces\n\nDisadvantage\n\n- calculations for how much history to remove can be slightly innacurate as they are based on estimated tokens per message\n- it rounds the number of messages to remove to the nearest number divisible by 5 (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, etc), so it is not as fine grained as manual numeric selection.\n\n***\n\n### Memory Recall Strategy\n\n#### Recall only from this chat\n\nThis is the default behavior of smart-context and pulls 'memories' only from the ChromaDB collection for this specific chat.\n\n#### Recall from all character chats\n\nThis is an experimental behavior of smart-context which pulls 'memories' from all ChromaDB collections for the selected character.\nHypothetically this should allow for the development of a more robust memory set spanning many interactions. \nReccomended that this be used with 'Add to Bottom' or 'Custom Depth' strategies and 'kept messages' set to a low number so that ChromaDB will pull from memory sooner.\n\n### Using Smart Context\n\nOnce it is enabled and configured, Smart Context happens automatically.\n\nChromaDB makes a new database for each chat that is opened inside SillyTavern.\nThis database is automatically filled with the entire chat history.\n\nYou can also manually insert text files into the database.\n\nThese text files do not have to be chats. They can be anything (wikipedia entries, fanfic, etc).\n\n#### Purging the Database\n\nYou can use the 'Purge DB' button to clear the database for the current chat.\n\nThis can be helpful if you find inaccurate memories have been stored (such as chat message you have since deleted or edited).\n\n***\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### What happens to the databases when I'm done chatting? Can I save them?\n\nFor locally installed Extras servers, Smart Context saves the databases. There is no need to save them manually in usual use cases.\n\nFor colab users, the databases are wiped when the extras server shuts down. Use the export button to save the database as a JSON file, and import it next time you want to use it.\n\n**Usually there is no need to save Smart Context databases.**\n\nCurrently we have an Import/Export feature, which allows you to save the chat's DB and use it again at a later date.\n\n#### Can I make one big database for all of my chats to reference?\n\nThis would not be a good use of Smart Context's capabilities.\nWe recommend using World Info for this purpose."

THIS PAGE IS KEPT FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES.**\n\n**### What is it?**\n\nAn implementation of Talking Head Anime 3 Demo for AITuber. It possesses the following features:\n\n- Generates random Live 2D-like motion actions from a single static image.\n- Lip-syncs to the sound output from any TTS output.\n\nThis extension contains the original demo programs for the Talking Head(?) Anime from a Single Image 3: Now the Body Too project. As the name implies, the project allows you to animate anime characters, and you only need a single image of that character to do so. There are two demo programs:\n\nThe manual_poser lets you manipulate a character's facial expression, head rotation, body rotation, and chest expansion due to breathing through a graphical user interface, so you can save them as default expressions IE Happy, sad, joy, etc.\nifacialmocap_puppeteer lets you transfer your facial motion to an anime character.\n\n### Hardware Requirements\n\nYou can use either CPU or GPU Modes (CPU is default). However, in CPU mode expect about 1 FPS, and in GPU mode on an RTX3060 I am getting about 9-10 FPS. \n\nThe ifacialmocap_puppeteer requires an iOS device that is capable of computing blend shape parameters from a video feed. This means that the device must be able to run iOS 11.0 or higher and must have a TrueDepth front-facing camera. (See this page for more info.) In other words, if you have the iPhone X or something better, you should be all set.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou must launch extras with the following modules for talkinghead to work: `classify` and `talkinghead`!\nclassify is required for the handling of the talkinghead.png file. Additionally, you may also use `--talkinghead-gpu` to load the blend models into GPU memory and make the animations 10x faster. It is highly recommended to use GPU acceleration! By default, once the program starts it will load a default image SillyTavern-extras\\talkinghead\\tha3\\images\\lambda_00.png. You can verify it is working by going to http://localhost:5100/api/talkinghead/result_feed or `YOUR EXT URL:PORT/api/talkinghead/result_feed`. \n\n- Once the server has started go to the Extension API tab and connect. Then simply select a character card to load. (`--enable-modules=classify,talkinghead --talkinghead-gpu` when starting server.py)\n\n- Now select the Character Expressions, if you check the image type talkinghead box the script will replace your current character expression with the result of `YOUR EXT URL:PORT/api/talkinghead/result_feed` unchecking the box SHOULD return the image back to the original expression, however sometimes you have to send a new message to the chat to \"reload\" the image.\n\n- If you do not have a talkinghead.png file in the character directory it will simply show either the default image or the last character card that had a talkinghead.png file. The animation source image is changed when the character card is changed. \n\n- Now open the character expressions scroll down to the talkinghead image and upload an image file that meets the requirements in the section below called \"Constraints on Input Images\".\n\n- Then check and uncheck the talkinghead box to reload the character. If the image is funny looking it is probably because it is not transparent / has no alpha layer. Otherwise, follow the instructions and template below. \n\n### Constraints on Input Images\nIn order for the system to work well, the input image must obey the following constraints:\n\nIt should be of resolution 512 x 512. (If the program receives an input image of any other size, it will resize the image to this resolution and also output at this resolution.)\nIt must have an alpha channel.\nIt must contain only one humanoid character.\nThe character should be standing upright and facing forward.\nThe character's hands should be below and far from the head.\nThe head of the character should roughly be contained in the 128 x 128 box in the middle of the top half of the image.\nThe alpha channels of all pixels that do not belong to the character (i.e., background pixels) must be 0.\n\n### ADVANCED SECTION\n\n### Python Environment\n\nIn addition to the base feature (app.py), both manual_poser and ifacialmocap_puppeteer are available as desktop applications. To run them, you need to set up an environment for running programs written in the Python language. The environment needs to have the following software packages:\n\n* Python >= 3.8\n* PyTorch >= 1.11.0 with CUDA support\n* SciPY >= 1.7.3\n* wxPython >= 4.1.1\n* Matplotlib >= 3.5.1\n\nOne way to do so is to install Anaconda and run the following commands in your shell:\n\n> conda create -n talking-head-anime-3-demo python=3.8\n> conda activate talking-head-anime-3-demo\n> conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch\n> conda install scipy\n> pip install wxpython\n> conda install matplotlib\n\n### Additional Blend Models\n\nThere is only one (lightest) model included, if you want the additional blend models you need to download the model files from https://www.dropbox.com/s/y7b8jl4n2euv8xe/talking-head-anime-3-models.zip?dl=0 and unzip it to the SillyTavern-extras\\talkinghead\\tha3\\models folder. In the end, the data folder should look like:\n\n+ tha3\n  + models\n    + separable_float\n      - editor.pt\n      - eyebrow_decomposer.pt\n      - eyebrow_morphing_combiner.pt\n      - face_morpher.pt\n      - two_algo_face_body_rotator.pt\n    + separable_half\n      - editor.pt\n          :\n      - two_algo_face_body_rotator.pt\n    + standard_float\n      - editor.pt\n          :\n      - two_algo_face_body_rotator.pt\n    + standard_half\n      - editor.pt\n          :\n      - two_algo_face_body_rotator.pt\n\nThe model files are distributed with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which means that you can use them for commercial purposes. However, Pramook Khungurn. Talking Head(?) Anime from a Single Image 3: Now the Body Too. <https://github.com/pkhungurn/talking-head-anime-3-demo>, is the creator.\n\n### Running the manual_poser Desktop Application\nOpen a shell. Change your working directory to the repository's root directory. Then, run:\n\n> python tha3/app/manual_poser.py\nNote that before running the command above, you might have to activate the Python environment that contains the required packages. \n\n> conda activate extras\nif you have not already activated the environment."

    "content": "# Live2D\n\nThis guide will walk you through the process of setting up and customizing the Live2D extension for your SillyTavern experience. This extension allows you to use Live2D animated models for your character, providing a dynamic and interactive element to your virtual character.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you've met the following prerequisites:\n\n1. **Branch Selection**: Make sure you're using the latest version of SillyTavern to access the latest features and updates.\n\n2. **Extension Installation**: Install the \"Live2D\" extension from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in the Extensions panel (represented by the stacked blocks icon).\n\n3. **Model Folder Placement**: Place your Live2D model folders into the `/data/<user-handle>/assets/live2d` directory. A properly organized `live2d` assets folder might look like this:\n\n    \n\n    - A Live2D model folder should include all necessary components for the Live2D model, such as expressions, motions, textures, sounds, and settings files. Notably the `***.model.json` file must be at the root of the Live2D model folder for the model to be detected by the extension. In this example the `shizuku` live2d model folder may look like this:\n\n    \n\n    - Note: Models can also be placed in character-specific folders, such as `/data/<user-handle>/characters/Shizuku/live2d/`. However, models in character folders will only be accessible for that specific character.\n\n## Extension Settings\n\nThe Live2D extension offers various settings to customize the behavior of your animated model. Here are the key settings:\n\n### Global Settings\n\n1. **Enabled**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to activate the extension, allowing your Live2D model to interact within SillyTavern.\n   - You can disable the extension if you want to use normal sprites only.\n   - You can disable the extension when you want to move normal sprites in a group chat and enable it again when you're ready to use Live2D models.\n\n2. **Follow Cursor**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to make the Live2D model follow your cursor, provided that the model supports this feature.\n\n3. **Auto-send Interaction**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to automatically trigger character interactions when you click on areas with mapped messages (refer to the hit areas section for details).\n\n## Debug Settings\n\nThese settings help you control the behavior and visibility of your Live2D model for debugging purposes.\n\n1. **Reset Model Before Animation**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to reload the model before any animation. This forces the animation to start and allows you to spam clicks if necessary. Some models may require this to ensure that animations begin from a compatible state.\n\n2. **Show Model Frames**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to display the model frame, making it easier to identify where to click to drag the model around. It also shows the hit area, if available. Hovering over a hit area will show its name.\n\n3. **Reload button**\n    - Click this button to reload every live2d model. Use it in case something glitches.\n\n## Character Selection\n\nThese settings allow you to manage characters and assign Live2D models to them.\n\n1. **Refresh Button**:\n   - Click the refresh button to update the list of characters in the current chat.\n\n2. **Select Character**:\n   - Use the drop-down list to choose a character to assign a Live2D model to.\n\n3. **Remove Button**:\n   - Click this button to delete all assigned models for a character. A confirmation prompt will appear to confirm the deletion.\n\n## Model Selection\n\n1. **Refresh Button**:\n   - Click the refresh button if your Live2D model does not appear in the list.\n\n2. **Select Model**:\n   - Choose a model from the list to assign it to the selected character.\n   - The model can be located in the asset folder or the current character's folder.\n   - The list displays the model folder name, its origin (asset or character), and the name of the detected model setting file.\n   - Note that some model folders may contain different versions of the same model. You can try different model files to see which one works best.\n   - Selecting none will use normal sprites if there is any\n   - Settings are saved per character and model\n\n## Model Settings\n\n1. **Model Scale**:\n   - Use the slider to adjust the size of the model, making it larger or smaller.\n\n2. **Model Center X Offset**:\n   - Use the slider to change the horizontal position of the model relative to the window center.\n\n3. **Model Center Y Offset**:\n   - Use the slider to adjust the vertical position of the model relative to the window center.\n\n### Remarks\n- The settings are saved and carry over different chats.\n- You can also drag the model with your mouse, and those settings will be updated and saved.\n- Use these UI settings to bring your model back on the screen if you somehow made it out of view. Also, check the \"Show frame\" checkbox to see clearly where you can click to drag the model.\n\n## Model Talk\n\n1. **Param mouth open Y id**\n    - Select from the list the ID of the parameter corresponding to the model's mouth Y value. Not all models have one, and names may vary from model to model. Usually something like \"PARAM_MOUTH_OPEN_Y\" or \"ParamMouthOpenY\". Check the model when selecting an element from the list; it will try to run the speak animation. If the mouth moves, you got it!\n\n2. **Mouth movement speed**\n    - Adjust the slider to change the movement speed of the mouth animation.\n\n3. **Time per character**\n    - Set the time duration of each character. The duration of the talk animation will be this time multiplied by the number of characters of the message.\n\n### Remarks\n- This mouth animation does not work on every model and every animation. Even if your model has animations where the mouth moves, it does not mean the mouth animation can be controlled by this extension. If nothing shows in the parameter list, your model is probably made with a too old version of Live2D to access the parameters properly.\n\n## Model Animations\n\n1. **Starter animation**\n    - Select an expression and motion from the lists that will play when starting a chat with the character. You can also add a delay during which the model will be invisible if you need to hide the character for some time to achieve a perfect effect.\n\n2. **Default animation**\n    - Select an expression and motion from the list that will play when the character sends a message. Use a fallback animation when using the classify expression extension.\n\n### Remarks\n- Animations will play when you select one in the lists.\n- Use the replay button to replay the selected animation.\n- Some models have expressions defined as motions.\n- If nothing shows in the lists, it's probable your model's setting file has no expressions/motions defined.\n\n## Hit areas mapping\n\n1. **Default click animation**\n    - Select an expression and motion from the list that will play when you click on the model. You can also set a message that will be sent as a user message.\n\n2. **Hit areas**\n    - If the model has hit areas, they will be listed, and you can assign an animation/message to each of them.\n\n### Remarks\n- Some models have no hit areas, but the default click is detected for all.\n- The default click will trigger if you click on a hit area with nothing mapped or if you click outside of any hit area.\n- Hit areas have priority defined in the model; for example, \"mouth\" is inside \"head.\" If it does not behave properly, it may be due to the model file.\n- For some models, animations need to be finished before starting another one. Use the debug checkbox if you want to force the refresh and spam animations.\n\n## Classified Expressions Mapping\n\n1. **Requirements**\n    - Requires the use of the classify expression extension; otherwise, it will fall back to the default animation.\n\n2. **Mapping**\n    - For each detected emotion by the classify extension, you can assign an expression/motion animation.\n\n### Remarks\n- If the previous animation did not finish when a new message is received, it's possible that the new animation will not play. This behavior is dependent on the Live2D model. Use the debug checkbox if you want to force the animation to play.\n\nThank you for following this guide! Your SillyTavern experience is now enriched with animated and interactive Live2D models."

The completion status of each task in the list will be checked at certain intervals.\n\nThis differs from adding static direction through prompting in that it adds sequential and paced directives for the AI to follow without user intervention. It gives a more genuine experience of the AI autonomously striving to reach a goal.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you've met the following prerequisites:\n\n- Make sure you're on the latest version of SillyTavern.\n- Install the \"Objective\" extension from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in the Extensions panel (stacked blocks icon).\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\nYour imagination is the limit, you can give the AI any objective you wish and it will plan out how to achieve it. You can ask it to plan how to slay a demon, rob a temple, throw a lavish party, or even take over the world.\n\n### Configuration\n\n- The extension is found in the Extensions menu under Objective.\n\n- Type an objective into the top text box, then click on `Auto-Generate Tasks`. This sends a request to the connected API and asks it to provide  a list of tasks which match the objective you have typed in.\n\n*Note: Clicking Auto-Generate Tasks will delete all existing tasks for the currently selected Objective before adding new ones.*\n\n- Upon receiving the response from the AI, a list of tasks will be created automatically in the space below the Objective input box. Tasks can be edited after creation.\n\n- At the bottom of the panel are two boxes: `Position in Chat` and `Task Check Frequency`\n  - `Position in Chat` - This is how 'deep' in the chat section of the prompt you want the current task to be inserted. The lower the number, the more attention the AI will give to the task. Setting to 0 will make the task the primary thing in the AI's mind. Setting at high values will put the task in the background and allow the AI to focus on the conversation at hand, but setting it too high may cause the AI to never 'get around' to the task at all.\n  - `Task Check Frequency` - This is how often you want the AI to check if the task has been completed. If it is set to `3`, the AI will be asked if the current task has been completed every 3rd message.\n\n-  Objectives, tasks, and their descriptions are saved in real-time to the current chat session. Custom prompts are saved globally.\n\n### Custom Prompts\nYou can customize the prompts sent to the LLM to generate tasks, check task completion, and for prompt injection. Editing prompts will save them for the current session. Custom prompts can be saved and loaded for persistence.\n\n- Click Edit Prompts to open the prompt editor window. You can edit your prompts as desired.\n- To save prompts, enter a name and click Save Prompt.\n- To load prompts, select the prompt from the dropdown list.\n- To delete a saved prompt, select it from the dropdown list and click Delete Prompt\n\n**WARNING: Task Checking happens in a separate API request. Setting Task Check Frequency to 1 will double your API calls to the LLM service. Be careful with this if you are using a paid service.**\n\n### Usage\n\nBy default the Objective extension will keep track of all tasks and their respective completion status automatically.\n\nThe User can also manually create, update, delete, and complete tasks at any time.\n\n#### Current Task Selection\n\nThe current task will always be the first listed incomplete task. Any manual updates to tasks will trigger a check for what the current task should be. So if you add a task above a bunch of completed tasks, it will be set as the current task. Once it's completed, previously completed tasks will be skipped and the next incomplete task will be selected as 'Current'.\n\nWhen using parent/child tasks in a task tree, tasks are selected depth-first, meaning all child tasks will be selected in order first, then continue down the list of tasks for the current Objective/Task.\n\n#### Branch Tasks\n\nClick the Branch Task button to set the current task as an Objective where you can auto generate or manually create tasks as child tasks. You can continue to turn any child task into an Objective and keep generating to your hearts content.\n\nMarking a parent task as complete will cause the extension to skip all subtasks. When all child tasks are complete, the parent task will be marked as complete\n\n#### Manually Complete Tasks\n\nYou can manually toggle the completion status of a task by `clicking the checkbox` next to it. This will set the next incomplete task to be selected.\n\n#### Manual Task Check\n\nIf you want to manually trigger the AI to check for task completion, click on the Extras Extension button (the `magic wand` on the right side of the chat input bar) and select `Manual Task Check`.\n\n#### Manually Add Tasks\n\nWhen no tasks are present, an `Add Task` button is visible, allowing you to manually create the first task.\n\nIf other tasks are already present, click the `+` button to the right of any task to insert a new task after it.\n\n#### Delete Tasks\n\nClick the red `x` to delete an existing task. The next incomplete task will be selected as the current task automatically.\n\nDeleting a task with child tasks will delete all child tasks and their descendants. \n\n#### Hiding Tasks\n\nIf you want to remain unaware of what tasks the AI is attempting to complete, check the `Hide Tasks` box to hide the task list and make the AI's intentions a mystery. For 100% mysteriousness, do this before clicking `Auto-Generate Tasks`!"

    "content": "# Regex\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe Regex extension lets the user automatically detect specific patterns in a string of text (called 'sequences') and apply manipulations (replacements) to them. It can be a powerful tool when used in conjuction with other SillyTavern features such as [Quick Replies or STscript](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md), or simply a way to remove certain words from a chat.\n\n## Helpful Links\n\n**This document will not explain the process of writing a RegEx sequence in depth. There are many online resources to assist you with that.**\n\n- https://regexr.com (https://regexr.com)\n\n- https://regex101.com (https://regex101.com)\n\n- https://extendsclass.com/regex-tester.html (https://extendsclass.com/regex-tester.html)\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nRegex is a built-in extension of SillyTavern, so no additional setup is required.\n\nYou may find its settings in the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-cubes\"></i> Extensions** panel.\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\nRegEx is often used to apply a find-replace function on certain words in the chat, to add markdown styles to certain words or sentence types, or to return a boolean value to an STscript.\n\n## Script List\n\n- The buttons at the top are used to make a new script.\n  - 'Global' scripts will apply to all characters and will be saved into `settings.json`.\n  - 'Scoped' scripts will only apply to the currently active character, and will be saved into the character card's data.\n- 'Import' lets you import RegEx scripts which were exported from another instance of SillyTavern.\n\nBelow this is a list of your scripts with some action buttons.\n\n- Drag handles (three horizontal bars to the left of the script name) let you drag/drop the scripts into any order you like.\n- Primary on/off switch can be quickly toggled to enable or disable the script without changing anything else. Disabled scripts are shown with ~~strikethrough~~ styling. **If a script is disabled here, it will be untriggerable by a Quick Reply or STscript.**\n- 'Edit' (pencil) button will open the RegEx script editor.\n- 'Move to scoped' (down arrow) will convert a global script to a scoped script and apply it to the current character. In reverse (up arrow), it would convert a scoped script to global.\n- 'Export' will cause your browser to download an exported `.json` file of the Script, which can then be shared and imported into another instance of SillyTavern.\n- 'Delete' (trashcan) deletes the script.\n\n## RegEx Editor\n\n- **Test Mode** : This will open a comparison view at the top of the editor. Type some text into the 'Input' box, and the results of your RegEx script will be shown in the Output box. It is a valuable debug tool as it will update the Output box in real time as you make changes to the script settings.\n\n- **Name** : The label for the script shown on the extension's script list. **This is also used to target the script when triggering it via slash command or STscript.**\n\n- **Find Regex** : This is the Regular Expression that is used to detect your targeted text pattern. This is usually the most complex part of any RegEx script, and is the easiest place to make mistakes. Refer to the links at the top of the page for information how to write a RegEx sequence. This box can resolve the values of [common SillyTavern macros](SillyTavern_Usage_Characters_macros.md) (such as \\{\\{user\\}\\}, \\{\\{char\\}\\}, etc) if the 'Macros in Find Regex' is set to do so (see below).\n\n- **Replace With**: This is what will replace the matched sequence. In a very simple example, if your 'Find Regex' is `apple`, and your 'Replace With' is `orange`, the first occurence of 'apple' would be automatically changed to 'orange' in any text where the script is applied.\n\n  - Adding the extension-specific macro \\{\\{match\\}\\} in this box will insert the full matched sequence of text. This is commonly used to apply styles to specific words. Going back to the above example, if \\*\\*\\{\\{match\\}\\}\\*\\* were put into the 'Replace With' box instead, all occurences of the word 'apple' would be replaced with `**apple**`, which would apply the bold markdown style to it.\n\n  - Variables such as $1, $2, $3 etc can be used to insert what are called 'Capture Groups'. These are substrings located in the text sequence matched by the 'Find Regex' sequence. **Note that using these variables requires the matching expression to contain sets of parentheses to define which part of the matched string counts as a captured group.** Refer to the links at the top for reference on how to set up Capture Groups.\n\n- **Trim Out** : text put in this box will be removed from the matched text sequence before the 'Replace With' process is applied. For example, if our match was 'apple', and the Trim Out box contains 'le', then the letters 'le' would be removed first before the 'Replace With' process is applied. Since our 'Replace With' box contains \\*\\*\\{\\{match\\}\\}\\*\\* it would result in `**app**` being put in as the replacement for 'apple' (first 'le' is removed, and the remaining matched text is given the bold markdown style). Multiple trims can be applied by adding a newline between each string you want to remove.\n\n- **Affects** : This list of checkboxes defines the text sources to which the RegEx script will be applied.\n  - 'User Input': script will be run against the contents of the user's typed input after they hit Send.\n  - 'AI Response': script will be run against the contents of the AI's response after it is received.\n  - 'Slash Commands': script will be run against the values inserted into prompt/chat by slash commands.\n  - 'World Info': script will be run on against contents of World Info entries as they are injected into the prompt. **Requires 'Alter Outgoing Prompt' to be checked (or both ephemerality boxes to be unchecked).**\n  - 'Reasoning': script will be run against the contents of the 'reasoning' object returned by Chat Completion API's like Gemini or Deepseek. If 'Alter Outgoing Prompt' is checked under Ephemerality, the script will also be applied to any reasoning blocks that are added into prompt in subsequent chat turns.\n  - **If everthing here is unchecked the script will never activate during normal chatting, but it can still be activated via slash command or STscript.**\n\n- **Other Options** :\n  - 'Disabled' prevents the script from running. This is used as an override to prevent the script from running when you simply don't want to change any of the script's settings and/or don't want to disable it entirely via the switch on the script list (as doing so would prevent slash commands from triggering it).\n  - 'Run on Edit' makes the script also run after a chat message has been edited. If this is unchecked, the contents of edited chat messages will not trigger the script.\n\n- **Macros in Find Regex** : Select whether or not to replace macros (such as \\{\\{user\\}\\}, \\{\\{char\\}\\}, etc) that are present in the Find Regex box's sequence.\n  - 'Don't Substitute' will cause any SillyTavern macros to be ignored so the RegEx script will treat them literally when searching.\n  - 'Raw' will send in the value of the macro verbatim. This might alter the way your RegEx script searches the text if the value of the macro contains certain special characters.\n  - 'Escaped' will add a RegEx escape slash `\\` before each character to ensure they do not accidentally alter the overall RegEx sequence. This can be useful if you have certain special characters in the values of the macro.\n\n### Depth Settings\n\nThe Min/Max Depth settings provide precise control over which messages in the chat history your regex pattern will affect:\n\n- **Min Depth**: Only affects messages that are at least N levels deep in the chat history\n  - 0 = last message\n  - 1 = second-to-last message\n  - etc.\n  - When blank (set to 'Unlimited'), or -1, will also affect the message to continue on the Continue action\n\n- **Max Depth**: Only affects messages no deeper than N levels in the chat history\n  - Must be greater than Min Depth for the regex to apply\n  - System prompts and utility prompts are not affected by these settings\n\nFor example, setting Min Depth to 0 and Max Depth to 2 would only apply your regex to the three most recent messages in the chat.\n\n### Flags\n\nBy default the Find Regex pattern is case-sensitive and applies only to the first match. To adjust this behavior, as well as other RegEx flags, you can add them like so:\n\n```txt\n/yourpattern/flags\n```\n\nExample: `/yourpattern/gi` will match all instances of 'yourpattern' in the text, regardless of case.\n\nSome of the most common flags are:\n\n- `i` : case-insensitive\n- `g` : global (applies to all matches, not just the first)\n- `s` : dotAll (treats the input as a single line, so `.` will match newlines)\n- `m` : multi-line (treats the input as multiple lines, so `^` and `$` match the start/end of each line, not just the whole string)\n- `u` : unicode (treats the input as unicode, so `\\d`, `\\w`, etc. will match unicode characters)\n\nFor more information on RegEx flags, see the following MDN page: Advanced searching with flags (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags)\n\n### Ephemerality\n\nBy default (when neither box here is checked) a RegEx script will directly edit the text values stored inside the chat's JSONL file. This ensures both the outgoing prompt and the chat display will always contain the same values. However, these changes to the chat file are irreversible.\n\nIf you do not want this to happen, you can enable either of the checkboxes here to limit the RegEx script's affects to only the display or the outgoing prompt.\n\nIf only one of the boxes is checked, there will be no changes made to the chat file, but **only the checked item** will be changed. This means you will be seeing one thing, but the LLM will be seeing another. Use this carefully.\n\nIf both are selected, the script will function as normal in all ways EXCEPT it will not write any changes to the chat file.\n\n## Advanced Use\n\nWhile RegEx is commonly used as a simple Find/Replace tool, it can also be used in more complex ways.\n\nFor example the 'Replace With' box could include a set of CSS rules and HTML to add a specific styled HTML element into your chat whenever a certain word is found. This will require the `Show <tags> in responses` box to be unchecked in the User Settings panel.\n\nThe script can also be set to never trigger during normal use, but could instead be triggered via slash command as part of a logic check inside an STscript. The 'Replace With' box would include a unique value the script recognizes to indicate if a logic check is true or false. This expands the utility of RegEx to the full capabilities of all slash commands, allowing for truly unlimited levels of control and automation based on the contents of the chat."

    "content": "# Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC)\n\nThis guide will walk you through using RVC, a technique that allows transferring voice features from one audio clip to another, enabling voices to speak in different tones and styles.\n\nEver enjoyed those famous \"Presidents Play X\" videos? They were created using RVC. With the RVC extension, you can make your SillyTavern characters speak in any voice you desire, be it anime, movie, or even your own unique voice.\n\nRVC is NOT TTS: it's more like speech-to-speech. It takes an audio clip as its input. In the background, what RVC does is work in tandem with SillyTavern's TTS extension: it waits for TTS to generate an audio file (which TTS would've done regardless of whether you use RVC or not), then RVC will perform a second pass that takes the TTS audio file and transforms it into the cloned voice from your RVC configuration.\n\n## RVC Setup\n\nSillyTavern's RVC supports several API sources that perform audio conversion:\n\n* rvc-python (https://github.com/daswer123/rvc-python)\n* SillyTavern Extras (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Extras) (deprecated)\n\n### Common prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you've met the following prerequisites.\n\n#### ffmpeg\n\nMake sure you have `ffmpeg` binary in your PATH environment variable. This tool is used to convert incoming audio.\n\n**Windows**:\n\n* Use the Toolbox in SillyTavern Launcher script to install ffmpeg automatically: <https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Launcher>\n* Or download the build here: <https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/>\n* How to modify PATH variable: <https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/>\n* To test whether you did things correctly, open a command prompt and run ```ffmpeg```. It should print the ffmpeg version and info.\n\n**Linux**:\n\nInstall ffmpeg using your package manager.\n\n```shell\n# Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install ffmpeg\n# Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S ffmpeg\n# Fedora\nsudo dnf install ffmpeg\n```\n\n**macOS**:\n\nInstall ffmpeg using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/):\n\n```shell\nbrew install ffmpeg\n```\n\n#### Make sure TTS is enabled and works\n\nRVC depends on TTS, you need to enable a TTS extension. Your TTS has to be already working properly and narrating your chats before you try to add RVC to the mix!\n\nPlease note, that:\n\n* System TTS engine does not support voice conversion at all.\n* Streaming TTS will wait for the audio stream to end before conversion.\n\n#### Install the extension\n\nInstall the \"RVC\" extension from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in the Extensions panel (stacked blocks icon).\n\n#### Enable RVC in SillyTavern*\n\nIn SillyTavern, navigate to **Extensions** > **RVC** and enable it.\n\n#### Pick the source\n\nIn the extension settings, choose an RVC source to use. Then proceed to the source-specific installation instructions.\n\n### rvc-python Setup\n\n#### 1. Install the package\n\nFollow the installation instructions from the GitHub page: rvc-python Installation (https://github.com/daswer123/rvc-python?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). It is recommended to follow CUDA installation instructions if you have an Nvidia GPU.\n\nIf you're experiencing problems when installing on Windows (e.g. building fairseq step fails), make sure the following software is installed on your PC:\n\n* Windows 10 SDK (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)\n* Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)\n\n#### 2. Prepare the models\n\nCreate a directory for storing RVC models. By default it is named `rvc_models` and is picked up from your current directory when starting up the server. Every model is a subfolder (its name will be visible in the UI) that should contain `.pth` (required) and `.index` (optional) files.\n\nRead more: rvc-python Model Management (https://github.com/daswer123/rvc-python?tab=readme-ov-file#model-management)\n\n#### 3. Start the API server\n\nStart the API server by running the following command:\n\n```shell\npython -m rvc_python api -p 5050 -l -md models_path\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* `5050` - sets a listening port for the server. Change if you want to host on a different port.\n* `models_path` - sets a path for models. Remove if you want to use the default `rvc_models` directory.\n* `-l` - sets the server to listen on all network interfaces. Remove to only listen on localhost.\n\n#### 4. Connect to the server\n\n* In the RVC extension settings, set an appropriate **rvc-python API URL**. By default, it will be `http://localhost:5050`.\n* Check the **Use CUDA** checkbox if you have installed rvc-python to support CUDA acceleration.\n* Press \"Refresh\" to load a list of available voices.\n\n#### 5. Configure a voice map\n\n**Voice map defines voice conversion settings for every character or user persona.**\n\n* To set up a voice map, choose your character or persona name from the \"Character\" dropdown, then choose an RVC \"Voice\", then click Apply.\n* Optionally, you can also configure other related settings such as pitch correction or filtering.\n* If you did everything correctly, the Voice Map debug area will show something like 'Betty:MyVoice(rvpme)'.\n\n### SillyTavern Extras Setup\n\n#### 1. Prepare RVC Model Files\n\n* In a file browser, navigate to: `\\SillyTavern-extras\\data\\models\\rvc`.\n* Create a subfolder like 'Betty' and place the `.pth` and `.index` files into it. (Hint: you can download voice files from https://voice-models.com, make sure the voice name says it's RVPME.)\n\n#### 2. Install Requirements\n\nInstall the necessary requirements using the command:\n\n```shell\npip install -r requirements-rvc.txt`\n```\n\n#### 3. Run SillyTavern-extras with RVC enabled\n\nLaunch SillyTavern-extras with the RVC module enabled. This example invocation assumes you used Edge TTS which comes pre-installed with SillyTavern-extras:\n\n```shell\npython server.py --enable-modules=rvc,edge-tts\n```\n\nOptionally, you may wish to run RVC on your GPU if you have a capable one, by adding ```--cuda``` to the startup command. Based on a quick test, VRAM usage was 3.4GB for narrating 50 tokens (~36 words), and 7.6GB for 200 tokens (~150 words).\n\n#### 4. Set Up Voice Mapping\n\nCreate a Voice map for RVC. Set your Character to your desired SillyTavern character name, and set Voice to the RVC folder you created at step 1, then click Apply. If you did things correctly, the Voice Map will show something like 'Betty:MyVoice(rvpme)'.\n\n#### 5. Select Pitch Extraction\n\n* Choose \"rmvpe\" as the pitch extraction method.\n* If you have trouble with \"rmvpe\" try other methods (for example, \"harvest\" or \"torchcrepe\").\n\n#### 6. (Optional) Configure RVC to save your generations to file\n\nIf for testing or troubleshooting purposes you wish to save the generated RVC audio, add ```--rvc-save-file``` to your startup command. This will save the last generation under `SillyTavern-extras/data/tmp/rvc_output.wav`:\n\n```shell\npython server.py --enable-modules=rvc,edge-tts --rvc-save-file\n```\n\n#### Expression-Based Dynamic Voice\n\n##### 1. Configure RVC Models\n\nIn your RVC model folder, have separate `.pth` and `.index` files for each classified expression (e.g., anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise).\n\n##### 2. Enable Modules\n\nEnable both RVC and classify modules:\n\n```shell\npython server.py --enable-modules=rvc,classify\n```\n\n##### 3. Use RVC Module\n\nThe remaining setup is similar to using the RVC module alone (as explained above).\n\n## Train Your Own RVC Model\n\n### Using RVC Easy Menu by Deffcolony (Windows Only)\n\nAutomatically install and launch Mangio-RVC: https://github.com/deffcolony/rvc-easy-menu\n\n#### 1. Clone Repository\n\nClone the repository to your desired location:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/deffcolony/rvc-easy-menu.git\n```\n\n#### 2. Launch RVC-Launcher.bat\n\n* Open the `RVC-Launcher.bat` file.\n* Choose option 1 to install RVC.\n\n#### 3. Complete Installation\n\nWhen prompted, install required packages and dependencies.\n\n#### 4. Open WebUI for Voice Training\n\nAfter installation, choose option 2 to open the WebUI for voice training.\n\n### Mangio-RVC: Training a Voice Model\n\n***Dataset Preparation***:\n\n**1. Prepare Audio**:\n\n* Place the audio you want to train in the `datasets` folder.\n* Ensure the audio is free of background noise \u2013 only raw voice is needed.\n* Longer audio makes a better output quality.\n\n***WebUI Training***:\n\n**1. Access Training Tab**:\n\n* Click on the training tab in the WebUI.\n\n**2. Configure Experiment**:\n\n* Enter an experiment name (e.g., `my-epic-voice-model`).\n* Set version to v2.\n\n**3. Process Data and Extract Features**:\n\n* Click \"Process data\" and \"Feature extraction\".\n* Set \"Save frequency\" to 50.\n\n**4.

Enable this by checking \"Enable messages mapping\".\n\n4. **Select Language**:\n   - Choose the language you want to speak (Note: not every browser supports all languages).\n\n5. **Recording**:\n   - To start recording, click the microphone button to the right of the message area next to the send button. Click again to stop recording. Recording may stop automatically if no voice is detected.\n\n## Speech Recognition Setup (API Sources)\n\nSupports sources like OpenAI, MistralAI, Groq, Chutes, Z.AI, and others that provide speech-to-text APIs.\n\nTo set up:\n\n1. Provide an API key for the chosen provider in the Chat Completion API settings.\n2. Launch SillyTavern and go to **Extensions** > **Speech Recognition**.\n3. Select the desired API source from the dropdown options.\n4. Configure additional settings as needed, similar to the \"Browser\" provider setup.\n\n## Speech Recognition Setup (Extras) - Deprecated\n\n**Requires ffmpeg binary installed. See [RVC setup](SillyTavern_extensions_RVC.md) for more details.**\n\n**1. **Enable Provider**:**\n\n   - Enable the desired speech recognition provider on the extras server using the following command:\n     ```shell\n     python server.py --enable-modules=whisper-stt\n     ```\n     or\n     ```shell\n     python server.py --enable-modules=vosk-stt\n     ```\n   - You can also use a custom model by adding the option `--stt-vosk-model-path` or `--stt-whisper-model-path` with the path to the model.\n\n2. **Configure SillyTavern**:\n   - Launch SillyTavern and go to **Extensions** > **Speech Recognition**.\n   - Select \"Vosk\" or \"Whisper\" from the dropdown options (whisper is more accurate).\n   - The settings are similar to the \"Browser\" provider setup (except for language) see above.\n\n## Speech Recognition Setup (Streaming) - Deprecated\n\n**Requires ffmpeg binary installed. See [RVC setup](SillyTavern_extensions_RVC.md) for more details.**\n\n**1. **Enable Provider**:**\n\n   - Enable the streaming speech recognition module on Sillytavern-extras with the following command:\n     ```shell\n     python server.py --enable-modules=streaming-stt\n     ```\n\n2. **Configure SillyTavern**:\n   - (Optional) Specify a custom Whisper model as in the Whisper setup above.\n   - (Optional but recommended) Set up trigger words in SillyTavern. Only messages starting with these trigger words will be sent to SillyTavern as actual messages. This prevents random speech or noise from being transcribed. Enable this with the checkbox. The trigger words can be included/excluded from the actual message using a checkbox.\n   - Other settings are similar to other providers.\n\nYou're now ready to transcribe your voice into text using speech recognition in SillyTavern."

Use the \"Image Generation\" item in the extensions context menu (wand).\n2. Type a `/sd (argument)` slash command with an argument from the Generation modes table. Anything else would trigger a \"free mode\" to make SD generate whatever you prompted. Example: `/sd apple tree` would generate a picture of an apple tree.\n3. Look for a paintbrush icon in the context actions for chat messages. This will force the \"Raw Message\" mode for the selected message.\n\nEvery generation mode besides raw message and free mode will trigger a prompt generation using your currently selected main generation API to convert chat context into the SD prompt.\nYou can configure the instruction template for generating prompts for every generation mode using the \"SD Prompt Templates\" settings drawer in the extensions panel.\n\n### Tips and tricks for the `/sd` command usage\n\n#### View all generated images\n\nTo view all saved images for a character (including other chats), open a gallery from a \"More...\" dropdown menu on a character info panel, or use a `/show-gallery` slash command.\n\n#### Specify a negative prompt\n\nUse a `negative` named argument before the prompt to enforce a specific negative prompt for this generation.\n\n```stscript\n/sd negative=\"fries\" cute tater farmer holding a tayto in a spud-field\n```\n\n#### Include a character-specific prefix\n\nUse a special `{{charPrefix}}` macro in free-prompt mode to include positive and negative prompt prefixes (if defined) for the current character.\n\n```stscript\n/sd {{charPrefix}}, riding a bike\n```\n\n#### Suppress a chat message\n\nYou can avoid posting a generated image into the chat by passing a `quiet=true` named argument. The image will still be added into the character gallery, and the command will produce a relative URL to the image that can be consumed by other commands.\n\nThe example below will send the generated image using Markdown as a user persona.\n\n```stscript\n/sd quiet=true me | /send Here's a picture of me: \n```\n\n### Image swipes\n\nImages swipes allow to reroll the image generation while keeping the same prompt. If a fixed seed is set, it will be randomized for the next generation. \n\nTo cycle through images, hover a mouse cursor (tap on mobile) over a generated image to reveal arrow buttons and swipes counter. Tapping right arrow on the latest image will generate a new one.\n\n*'Swipes' here is just a name, don't try the actual swiping gesture, as this will regenerate the message itself, not the attached image.*\n\n## Options\n\n### Edit prompts before generation\n\nAllow to edit the automatically generated prompts manually before sending them to the Stable Diffusion API.\n\n### Use function tool\n\nUses [function calling](SillyTavern_extensions_Stable-Diffusion.md) to automatically detect the intention to generate an image.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. Must have image generation configured with a supported source.\n2. Must use a supported Chat Completion API model and have function tool calling enabled in the AI Response settings.\n3. The \"Use function tool\" option must be enabled in the Image Generation settings.\n4. The user should express an intent to generate an image in the chat message, e.g. \"Send me a picture of a cat\".\n\nThe interactive mode will not trigger when the function tool is enabled.\n\n**### Use interactive mode**\n\nAllows to trigger an image generation instead of text as a reply to a user message that follows the special pattern:\n\n1. Contains one of the following verbs: send, mail, imagine, generate, make, create, draw, paint, render\n2. Followed by one of the following nouns (not further than 10 characters away): pic, picture, image, drawing, painting, photo, photograph\n3. Followed by a target subject of image generation, could be optionally preceded by phrases like \"of a\" or \"of this\".\n\nExamples of valid requests and captured subjects:\n\n* `Can you please send me a picture of a cat` => `cat`\n* `Generate a picture of the Eiffel tower` => `Eiffel tower`\n* `Let's draw a painting of Mona Lisa` => `Mona Lisa`\n\nSome special subjects trigger a predefined generation mode:\n\n* 'you, 'yourself' => \"Yourself\"\n* 'your face', 'your portrait', 'your selfie' => \"Your Face\"\n* 'me', 'myself' => \"Me\"\n* 'story', 'scenario', 'whole story' => \"The Whole Story\"\n* 'last message' => \"The Last Message\"\n* 'background', 'scene background', 'scene', 'scenery', 'surroundings', 'environment' => \"Background\"\n\n### Extend free-mode prompts\n\nWhen using the interactive mode of the slash command, automatically extend free-mode generation subject descriptions by prompting your main API.\n\n### Snap auto-adjusted resolutions\n\nSnap image generation requests with a forced aspect ratio (portraits, backgrounds) to the nearest known resolution, while trying to preserve the absolute pixel counts. Refer to the \"Resolution\" dropdown for the list of possible options.\n\n**Recommended for SDXL models**.\n\n## Common prompt prefix\n\n**Pro Tip**\n\nUse `{prompt}` macro to specify where exactly the generated prompt will be inserted.\n\n**Added before every generated or free-mode prompt. Commonly used for setting the overall style of the picture.**\n\nExample: `best quality, anime lineart`.\n\n## Negative prompt\n\nCharacteristics of the image you don't want to be present in the output.\n\nExample: `bad quality, watermark`.\n\n## Character-specific prompt prefix\n\n**Pro Tip**\n\nIf supported by the generation source, you can also use LoRAs/embeddings here, for example: `<lora:DonaldDuck:1>`.\n\n**Any characteristics that describe the currently selected character. Will be added after a common prefix.**\n\nExample: `female, green eyes, brown hair, pink shirt`.\n\nYou can also specify a negative prompt prefix for any unwanted content. It will be combined with the general negative prompt.\n\nLimitations:\n1. Works only in 1-to-1 chats. Will not be used in groups.\n2. Won't be used for backgrounds and free mode generations.\n\nTo force include a character prefix into a free mode prompt, use the `{{charPrefix}}` macro anywhere in the prompt.\n\n**If you want to share the prefixes with others, tick the \"Shareable\" checkbox. This will save them with the character data, rather than your local settings.**\n\n## Styles\n\nUse this to quickly save and restore your favorite style/quality presets to use them later or when switching between models. The following is included in the Style preset:\n\n1. Common Prompt Prefix\n2. Negative Prompt\n\nYou can also switch between styles using the `/imagine-style` command (or `/sd-style` or `/img-style`).\n\n## Chat Message Visibility\n\nGenerated images inserted into the chat are hidden in the main API prompts by default, but this can be overriden individually per generation initiator (\"Magic wand\" icon, slash command, interactive mode). This can be used for making the experience more immersive by letting the characters \"acknowledge\" the images. Multimodal models in Chat Completions API may also 'see' the images if \"Send inline images\" is enabled.\n\nA text message can be customized by changing the \"Chat Message Template\" under Image Prompt Templates. All regular macros can be used in this template, plus a special `{{prompt}}` macro to specify where the image prompt will be added.\n\n## ComfyUI Configuration\n\nComfyUI (https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) is a fast and very flexible option for image generation. \n\nIf you're familiar with ComfyUI, the tl;dr is: make your workflow in ComfyUI, download it **in API format**, and paste it into the SillyTavern ComfyUI Workflow Editor. ST will submit your workflow to ComfyUI's API and you will get an image in your chat. But with great power comes great responsibility, and the main responsibility is inserting placeholders in your workflow JSON so you can change settings from SillyTavern.\n\nIf you're not familiar with ComfyUI, you can still use it to generate images in SillyTavern using the default workflow. Later, when you want great power, you can learn how to use ComfyUI...\n\n### Controls\n\nThis panel allows you to configure and manage your ComfyUI integration with SillyTavern.\n\n#### Server Type\n\n* Standard Server is when you call ComfyUI directly whether on your local machine or hosted elsewhere.\n* RunPod Serverless Endpoint is for running ComfyUI through RunPod's serverless API (https://www.runpod.io/product/serverless). Serverless can be a good option for remote generation as you can get the same control over workflows as a standard server but can take advantage of more powerful hosted GPUs and only be charged when you're actively generating images. The majority of the usage is the same. Differences from standard server setup and behavior is described [below](SillyTavern_extensions.md).\n\n#### Standard Server setup\n\nEnter the URL of your ComfyUI server in the **ComfyUI URL** input field. The default value is `http://127.0.0.1:8188`. \nIf you are using SwarmUI (https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI), the default port for the \nmanaged ComfyUI server (https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI/blob/master/src/BuiltinExtensions/ComfyUIBackend/README.md) is `7821`, \n20 ports higher than the default port for SwarmUI.\n\nAfter entering the URL, choose <i class=\"fa-solid fa-check\"></i> **Connect** to validate and establish a connection. The ComfyUI server must be accessible from the SillyTavern host machine.\n \n#### ComfyUI RunPod Setup\n\n* You'll need a RunPod account and to add some money to it. You can probably expect around 2 cents per image for Qwen image generation on an RTX 4090 though YMMV. $5 in credits should last a while.\n* <https://console.runpod.io/hub/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui> is a flux1 dev configuration that you can use to create your own serverless endpoint.\n  * There is information there on creating your own configuration if you want to use a different model or add LoRAs.\n* Create an API key for access to the serverless endpoint: <https://console.runpod.io/user/settings>\n\n* In ST, select **ComfyUI** as the **Source** and **RunPod Serverless Endpoint** as the **Server Type**.\n* Set the **ComfyUI RunPod URL** to the URL of your endpoint.\n* Set the API key.\n* Click **Connect**. If the API key and URL are correct, you should get toasts indicating success.\n* The ComfyUI workflow configuration flow is the same as local.\n  * Use the \"Export (API)\" option.\n  * Depending on your local setup, you may need to/want to pick a variation of the model for use on RunPod. For example, if you use a quantized GGUF locally, but want to use an fp16 version on RunPod. The JSON workflow you use in ST needs to have this change.\n  * Model, samplers, VAE, etc cannot be determined dynamically so your workflow needs to have these hard coded (no `%model%` substitution).\n  * Other substitutions should work the same as local.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe serverless configuration does not currently embed the workflow into the output image. i.e., you won't be able to drag/drop the image into local ComfyUI to see the seed or prompt. This is just a limitation of the RunPod handler and is a capability that could be added on that side.\n\n**### Workflow Management**\n\nSelect a ComfyUI workflow from the dropdown menu. Two default workflows are provided:\n\n- Default_Comfy_Workflow.json: A basic text-to-image workflow supporting the most common image generation settings.\n- Char_Avatar_Comfy_Workflow.json: A sample image-to-image workflow that uses the character avatar, plus the prompt, to generate an image.\n\nUse the following buttons to manage your workflows:\n\n- <i class=\"fa-solid fa-pen-to-square\"></i> **Open workflow editor** to view and modify the selected workflow.\n- <i class=\"fa-solid fa-plus\"></i> **Create new workflow** to create a new workflow with a custom name.\n- <i class=\"fa-solid fa-trash-can\"></i> **Delete workflow** to remove the selected workflow.\n\n### Workflow Editor\n\nThe ComfyUI Workflow Editor allows you to view and modify ComfyUI workflows for use with SillyTavern.\n\nThe main component of the editor is a large text area where you can insert or edit your ComfyUI workflow in JSON format.\n\nTo add a ComfyUI workflow to the editor, follow these steps:\n\n1. Enable 'Dev Mode' in ComfyUI settings.\n2. Use the 'Save (API Format)' option in ComfyUI to download the JSON data.\n3. Create a new workflow in SillyTavern and open the editor.\n4. Paste the downloaded JSON data into the text area.\n5. Replace specific values with placeholders as needed for your use case.\n\n**Tips**\n\nYou can add the API-format JSON file directly to the `data/default-user/user/workflows` directory in your SillyTavern installation. This will save you from steps 3 and 4.\n\nRetain the original JSON file. If you need to open the workflow again in ComfyUI to make changes, it is much more convenient to edit the original file than the one with all the placeholders.\n\n**### Placeholders**\n\nThe editor provides a list of predefined placeholders that can be used in your workflow JSON. These placeholders are replaced with dynamic values when the workflow is executed in SillyTavern.\n\nPlaceholders marked with \u2705 are present in your workflow JSON. Placeholders marked with \u274c are not present in your workflow JSON. You can add these placeholders to your workflow JSON as needed. You do not need to add all the placeholders, only the ones that your workflow uses and you want to replace dynamically.\n\n#### Prompts\n\nThe `%prompt%` and `%negative_prompt%` placeholders are used to insert the image generation prompts into the workflow. These contain the final prompts generated by SillyTavern, including the generated prompt for your chosen `/sd` mode, the common prompt prefix, negative prompt, and character-specific prompt prefix.\n\nFor example, you may have tested your workflow with a prompt like \"forest elf\" in ComfyUI. To use this workflow in SillyTavern, you can replace the \"forest elf\" prompt with the `%prompt%` placeholder:\n\n+++ JSON with placeholder\n```json\n{\n    \"class_type\": \"CLIPTextEncode\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n        \"clip\": [\"4\", 1],\n        \"text\": \"%prompt%\"\n    }\n}\n```\n+++ Original JSON\n```json\n{\n    \"class_type\": \"CLIPTextEncode\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n        \"clip\": [\"4\", 1],\n        \"text\": \"forest elf\"\n    }\n}\n```\n+++\n\nNotice that the placeholder is wrapped in double quotes. This is important for the JSON format, and required by SillyTavern's placeholder replacement system. Even for numbers, you must use double quotes in the template JSON.\n\nSometimes the prompt (or other value) doesn't appear where you might expect. ComfyUI will remove nodes from the API version of the workflow if they are not necessary for the workflow to function in API mode. \n\nFor instance, this workflow uses a LoRA tag loader node (https://github.com/badjeff/comfyui_lora_tag_loader) with a prompt primitive so the workflow is clearer in UI mode:\n\nThe prompt primitive node will be removed from the API version of the workflow, so you insert the placeholder in the LoraTagLoader node. Find the text \"apple tree\" in the workflow and replace it with the `%prompt%` placeholder:\n\n+++ JSON with placeholder\n```json\n{\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"text\": \"%prompt%\",\n      \"model\": [\"112\", 0],\n      \"clip\": [\"112\", 1]\n    },\n    \"class_type\": \"LoraTagLoader\",\n    \"_meta\": {\"title\": \"Load LoRA Tag\"}\n}\n```\n+++ Original JSON\n```json\n{\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"text\": \"apple tree\",\n      \"model\": [\"112\", 0],\n      \"clip\": [\"112\", 1]\n    },\n    \"class_type\": \"LoraTagLoader\",\n    \"_meta\": {\"title\": \"Load LoRA Tag\"}\n}\n``` \n+++\n\nIn some cases you may need to make several replacements in the workflow JSON, even if the prompt appears only once in the UI. \n\n#### Model\n\nThe `%model%` placeholder will insert the value of the selected model in the image generation settings. \n\nAn example from the default text-to-image workflow:\n\n+++ JSON with placeholder\n```json\n{\n    \"class_type\": \"CheckpointLoaderSimple\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n        \"ckpt_name\": \"%model%\"\n    }\n}\n```\n+++ Original JSON\n```json\n{\n    \"class_type\": \"CheckpointLoaderSimple\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n        \"ckpt_name\": \"sd15.safetensors\"\n    }\n}\n```\n+++\n\nTo load GGUF-quantized UNets, use a UNet Loader (GGUF) (https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) node in your workflow, \nchoose a `GGUF` model in the SillyTavern model dropdown, and use the `%model%` placeholder in the node's settings like this:\n\n+++ JSON with placeholder\n```json\n{\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"unet_name\": \"%model%\"\n    },\n    \"class_type\": \"UnetLoaderGGUF\",\n    \"_meta\": {\n      \"title\": \"Unet Loader (GGUF)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n+++ Original JSON\n```json\n{\n    \"inputs\": {\n      \"unet_name\": \"flux1-dev-Q4_0.gguf\"\n    },\n    \"class_type\": \"UnetLoaderGGUF\",\n    \"_meta\": {\n      \"title\": \"Unet Loader (GGUF)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n+++\n\n**If you have model types other than the usual SD checkpoints in ComfyUI**\n\nStable Diffusion checkpoints, SD UNets, and GGUF-quantized UNets all appear in the Model dropdown.\nModels of one type will not work with workflows/loader nodes expecting another type.\nIf you choose an incompatible model type in ST, ComfyUI will report a problem with the loader node.\n\n**#### Avatar images**\n\nUse the `%user_avatar%` and `%char_avatar%` placeholders to include the user and character avatars in the workflow. These placeholders are replaced with the PNG data of the avatars when the workflow is executed. The image data is encoded in base64 format, so you must decode it in your workflow. A popular choice for this task is the Load image (Base64) (https://github.com/Acly/comfyui-tooling-nodes) node.\n\nIn this example, the character avatar is loaded with a `Load Image (Base64)` node. It also uses an Image Resize node to rescale the image to whatever size is specified in the image generation settings:\n\nInsert the `%char_avatar%`, `%width%`, and `%height%` placeholders into the JSON for the Load Image (Base64) and Image Resize nodes:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"97\": {\n        \"inputs\": {\n            \"image\": \"%char_avatar%\"\n        },\n        \"class_type\": \"ETN_LoadImageBase64\",\n        \"_meta\": {\"title\": \"Load Image (Base64)\"}\n    },\n    \"98\": {\n        \"inputs\": {\n            \"mode\": \"resize\",\n            \"resize_width\": \"%width%\",\n            \"resize_height\": \"%height%\",\n            \"image\": [\"97\", 0]\n        },\n        \"class_type\": \"Image Resize\",\n        \"_meta\": {\"title\": \"Resize image\"}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo get a base64-encoded image string for testing your workflow in ComfyUI, use any online tool that converts images to base64 strings. \nHere's an example string you can use for initial testing: sd-comfy-base64-test-string.txt.\n\n#### Other placeholders\n\nMost other placeholders use the values of the corresponding controls in image generation settings, or the values that you specify with the `/sd` command:\n\n- `%vae%`, but most SD models include a VAE so the default workflows do not use this placeholder. Use it with custom workflows to load a VAE alongside a UNet, override the default VAE, etc.\n- `%sampler%`\n- `%scheduler%`\n- `%steps%`\n- `%scale%`\n- `%width%`\n- `%height%`\n- `%denoise%`: for the sample image-to-image workflow, vary the denoise amount between about 0.5 (barely-noticeable changes to the source image) and 1.0 (a completely different image as if no source image was used). Not used by the default text-to-image workflow because there's no point using a value other than 1.0 for text-to-image.\n- `%clip_skip%`: not used by the default workflows but available for custom workflows.\n\nThe `%seed%` placeholder will insert the seed value from the control if you have specified one. If you set the seed to `-1`, SillyTavern will generate a new random seed for each image in `%seed%`. \n\n#### Custom placeholders\n\nYou can add custom placeholders to your workflow:\n\n1. Look for the \"Custom\" section below the predefined placeholders.\n2. Click the \"+\" button to add a new custom placeholder.\n3. Enter a name for the placeholder in the `find` field.\n4. Enter the value that you want to replace the placeholder with in the `replace` field.\n\nCustom placeholders will appear in a separate list below the predefined ones.\n\nFor example, you could replace the \"SillyTavern\" prefix for saved image filenames in the default workflow with a custom placeholder. Add a new custom placeholder with `find` set to `filename_prefix` and `replace` set to `ServiceTesnor`. Insert the new `%filename_prefix%` placeholder into your workflow JSON. Now you can change the filename prefix from SillyTavern to ServiceTesnor by changing the value of the custom placeholder.\n\n+++ JSON with placeholder\n```json\n{\n    \"class_type\": \"SaveImage\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n        \"filename_prefix\": \"%filename_prefix%\",\n        \"images\": [\"8\", 0]\n    }\n}\n```\n+++ Original JSON\n```json\n{\n    \"class_type\": \"SaveImage\",\n    \"inputs\": {\n        \"filename_prefix\": \"SillyTavern\",\n        \"images\": [\"8\", 0]\n    }\n}\n```\n+++\n\n### Comfy tricks\n\nRead all the general information on this page so you're familiar with the image generation options. Options such as switchable styles and common prompt prefixes, when combined wih the total flexibility of ComfyUI workflows, allow you to create a wide variety of image generation setups.\n\n#### Loading LoRAs\n\nUse a LoRA tag loader node (such as Load LoRA Tag (https://github.com/badjeff/comfyui_lora_tag_loader)) to load any LoRAs specified in the prompt. \nNow you can add as many LoRAs as you like to your prompt with tags like `<lora:CroissantStyle:0.8>`, and they will be loaded into your workflow. \nThis will also make the \"pro-tip\" of using LoRAs in [character-specific prompt prefixes](SillyTavern_extensions.md) work with ComfyUI.\n\n#### Setting workflow values from styles or slash-commands\n\nYou can use macros in custom placeholder values. As a practical example, \nlet's say you sometimes want to generate images without a background, and you'd like this to be switchable with a \nslash-command or image style. Here's how you could do it:\n\n1. Make a ComfyUI workflow that removes the image background, or not, depending on the value of an input\n2. Use a custom placeholder to set the value of that input, but use `{{getvar::remove_background}}` as the replace value\n3. Now you can set the value of `remove_background` with `/setvar key=remove_background true` or `/setvar key=remove_background false` before generating an image\n4. The workflow will use the value you set to determine whether to remove the background\n5. Make an image style \"No background\" with common prompt prefix `{{setvar::remove_background::true}}`\n6. Use the style control or `/imagine-style No background` to set the value of `remove_background` to `true` before generating an image"

    "content": "# Summarize\n\n## What is it?\n\nThis extension allows you to create, store, and utilize automatically generated summaries based on the events happening in your chats. Summarization can help with outlining general details of what is happening in the story, which *could* be interpreted as a long-term memory, but take that statement with a grain of salt. Since the summaries are generated by language models, the outputs may lose some important details or contain hallucinations, so you're always advised to keep track of the summary state and correct it manually if needed.\n\n## Common configuration\n\nThe summarization extension is installed in SillyTavern by default, thus it will show up in ST's Extensions panel (stacked cubes icon) list like this:\n\n- **Current summary** - displays and provides an ability to modify the current summary. The summary is updated and embedded into the chat file's metadata for the message that was the last in context when the summary was generated. Deleting or editing a message from the chat that has a summary attached to it, will revert the state to the last valid summary.\n- **Restore Previous** - removes the current summary, rolling it back to the previous state. This is useful if the summarizer does a poor job at any given point.\n- **Pause** - check this to prevent the summary from being automatically updated. This is useful if you want to provide a custom summary of your own or to effectively disable the summary by clearing the box and stopping updates.\n- **Popup window** - allows to detach the summary into a movable UI panel on the sidebar. Useful for the desktop layout to easily have access to summarization settings without having to navigate through the extensions menu.\n- **Injection Template** - defines how the summary will be wrapped when being inserted into regular chat prompts. A special \\{\\{summary\\}\\} macro should be used to denote the exact location of the current summary state in the prompt injection text.\n- **Injection Position** - sets the location of the prompt injection. The options are the same as for Author's Notes: before or after the main prompt, or in-chat at designated depth.\n\n## Supported summary sources\n\n### Main API\n\nSummarization will be powered by your currently selected AI backend, model and settings. This method requires no additional setup, just a working API connection.\n\nThis option has the following sub-modes that differ depending on how the summary prompt is built:\n\n1. Raw, blocking. The summary will be generated using nothing but the summarization prompt and the chat history. Subsequent prompts will also include the previous summary with messages that were sent after the summary was generated (see example). This mode can (and will) generate prompts that have a lot of variability between them, so it is not recommended to use it with backends that have slow prompt processing times, such as llama.cpp and its derivatives.\n2. Raw, non-blocking. Same as above, but the chat generation will not be blocked during the summary generation. Not every backend supports simultaneous requests, so switch to blocking mode if summarization fails.\n3. Classic, blocking. The summarization prompt will be sent at the end of your usual generation prompt, as a neutral system instruction, not omitting the character card, main prompt, example dialogues and other parts of chat prompts. This usually results in prompts that play nicely with reusing processed prompts, so it is recommended to use with llama.cpp and its siblings.\n\n#### Summary Settings explained\n\n1. **Summary Prompt** - defines the prompt that will used for creating a summary. May include any of the known macros, as well as a special \\{\\{words\\}\\} macro (see below).\n2. **Target summary length (words)** - defines the value of the \\{\\{words\\}\\} macro that can be inserted into the Summary Prompt. This setting is completely optional and has no effect at all if the macro is not used.\n3. **API response length (tokens)** - allows to set an override API response length for generating summaries that are different from the globally set value.\n4. **Max messages per request _(raw modes only)_** - set to limit the maximum number of messages that will be included in one summarization prompt. `0` means no explicit limitation, but the resulting number of messages to summarize will still depend on the maximum context size, calculated using the formula: `max summary buffer = context size - summarization prompt - previous summary - response length`. Use this when you want to get more focused summaries on models with large context sizes.\n5. **No WI/AN** - omit World Info and Author's Note from text to be summarized. Only has an effect when using the Classic prompt builder. The Raw prompt builder always omits WI/AN.\n6. **Update every X messages** - sets the interval at which the summary is generated. `0` means that the automatic summarization is disabled, but you can still trigger it manually by clicking the \"Summarize now\" button. This should be adjusted based on how quickly the prompt buffer entirely fills with chat messages. Ideally, you'd want to have the first summary generated when the messages are starting to get dropped out of the prompt.\n7. **Update every X words** - same as above, but using words (not tokens!) instead of messages, theoretically can be a more accurate measurement due to how unpredictable the contents of chat messages usually are, but your mileage may vary.\n\nIf both \"Update every\" sliders are set to a non-zero value, then both will trigger summary updates at their respective intervals, depending on what happens first. It is strongly advised to update these values accordingly when you switch to another model that has differing context sizes, otherwise, the summary generation may trigger too often, or never at all.\n\nIf you're unsure about the interval settings, you can click the \"magic wand\" button above the \"Update every\" sliders to try and guess the optimal values based on some simple heuristics. A brief description of the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Calculate token and word counts for all chat messages\n2. Determine target summary length based on desired prompt words\n3. Calculate the maximum number of messages that can fit in the prompt based on the average message length\n4. If \"Max messages\" is set, adjust the average to account for messages that don't fit the summary limit\n5. Round down the adjusted average messages per prompt to a multiple of 5\n\n#### Example prompts\n\n**Raw prompt**\n```\nSystem:\n[Summarization prompt]\n\nPrevious summary.\n\nUser:\nMessage foo.\n\nChar:\nMessage bar.\n```\n\n**Classic prompt**\n```\n[Main prompt]\n\n[Character card]\n\n[Example dialogues]\n\nUser:\nMessage foo.\n\nChar:\nMessage bar.\n\nSystem:\n[Summarization prompt]\n```\n\n### Extras API\n\nExtras server with the `summarize` module could run an auxiliary summarization model (BART).\n\nIt has a very small context size (~1024 tokens), so its ability to handle large summaries is quite limited.\n\nTo configure the Extras summary source, do the following:\n\n1. Install or Update Extras (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-extras) to the latest version.\n2. Run Extras with the `summarize` module enabled: `python server.py --enable-modules=summarize`\n\n#### Changing Summary Model\n\nBy default, Summarize uses the Qiliang/bart-large-cnn-samsum-ChatGPT_v3 (https://huggingface.co/Qiliang/bart-large-cnn-samsum-ChatGPT_v3) model for summarization purposes.\n\nThis can be changed by using the command line argument `--summarization-model=(###Hugging-Face-Model-URL-Here###)`\n\nA known alternate Summarize model is `Qiliang/bart-large-cnn-samsum-ElectrifAi_v10`."

This example uses the `/input` and `/buttons` commands\nto gather user input:\n\n```shell\n/input default=\"Hello, world!\" <span data-i18n=\"Test Message\">Sample text</span> | \n/let key=input ||\n/buttons labels=[\"zh-CN\", \"zh-TW\", \"es\", \"hu\", \"en\"] <span data-i18n=\"UI Language\">Language</span> | \n/let key=lang ||\n/translate target={{var::lang}} {{var::input}} | /let key=tx_target | \n/translate | /let key=tx_orig ||\n/echo escapeHtml=false cssClass=wider_dialogue_popup\n<b data-i18n=\"Test Message\">Test message</b>: {{var::input}} \n<b data-i18n=\"Output\">Output</b> ({{var::lang}}): {{var::tx_target}} \n<b data-i18n=\"Output\">Output</b> (<span data-i18n=\"ext_translate_target_lang\">target language</span>): {{var::tx_orig}} \n```\n\nThis is useful for checking the quality of a translation into a language that you don't speak, before writing it\nsomewhere important.\n\nThe UI controls are shown in the current locale, independent of the configured target language.\n\n| `/input`                                                                                        | `/buttons`                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nInput language detection is relatively effective in the following examples:\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- UTF-8 encoding, special characters, and emojis are supported\n- Handles large messages by splitting into chunks when needed\n- Preserves formatting and embedded images in messages\n- Caches translations to avoid redundant API calls\n\n### AI input language\n\n`internal_language` controls the language into which user messages are auto-translated before being sent to the AI. It\nis hardcoded to 'en' in the default settings and cannot be changed through the UI. Thus, the translation target language\nfor messages *to the AI* is always English. Previous testing showed that AI performance was better when receiving\nEnglish messages, but this may change as more LLMs are being trained on more varied language data. I suppose one could\nchange `internal_language` in `settings.json` and find out.\n\n### Chinese variant handling\n\nThe extension supports both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, but not all translation providers do. The UI presents\nthese as 'Chinese (Simplified)' and 'Chinese (Traditional)' respectively, with language codes 'zh-CN' and 'zh-TW'. They\nare mapped to the following language codes for translation providers:\n\n* Libre Translate: 'zh-CN' to 'zh' and 'zh-TW' to 'zt'.\n* DeepL and DeepLX: both variants to 'ZH'.\n* Bing: 'zh-CN' to 'zh-Hans', 'zh-TW' as-is.\n* Other providers use 'zh-CN' and 'zh-TW' as provided.\n\n### Text length limits\n\nSome providers have character limits per request:\n\n- Yandex: 5000 characters\n- DeepLX: 1500 characters\n- Bing: 1000 characters\n- Google: 5000 characters\n\nLonger texts are automatically split into chunks for translation."

    "content": "# TTS\n\nSillyTavern has a wide range of TTS (text-to-speech) options that are used to have a voice narrate parts of your chat. This page explains the setup and use.\n\n## Configuring TTS\n\n### TTS Provider Selection\n\nUsed to select which TTS service you want to use. Some of the options are free, some require a paid subscription, and some run locally on your PC.\n\nAvailable options (list may change over time):\n\n- **AllTalk** - free, open source local installation, offers a variety of TTS engines. See the [AllTalk](SillyTavern_extensions_AllTalk.md) page for setup instructions.\n- **Azure TTS** - same voices as Microsoft Edge. Requires an Azure account and a paid subscription.\n- **Coqui-TTS** (deprecated) - free, requires Extras API to run. High-performance Text2Speech models (Tacotron, Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, SpeedySpeech) as well as Bark.\n- **Edge** - free, runs via Azure. When running with \"Plugin\" selected as the provider, you also need to install this server plugin (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-EdgeTTS-Plugin). Other option requires Extras API (deprecated) to run.\n- **Electron Hub** - reuses your Electron Hub (https://electronhub.ai/) API key to access cloud voices (GPT-4o Mini TTS, Microsoft neural voices, etc.) with per-model controls.\n- **ElevenLabs** - paid subscription required. Get an API key from ElevenLabs (https://elevenlabs.io/).\n- **Google Translate** - a free voice provided by Google, one per language, quality can vary widely.\n- **Google Gemini TTS** - requires an API key from either [Vertex AI](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_google.md) or [AI Studio](SillyTavern_Usage_API_Connections_google.md), uses Gemini TTS (https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/gemini-tts) models.\n- **Kokoro** - free, uses kokoro.js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/kokoro-js) to run the model locally in your browser. However, some browsers (https://caniuse.com/webgpu) may not support WebGPU for the device option.\n- **MiniMax** - requires an API key from MiniMax (https://www.minimax.io/). See the [MiniMax TTS](SillyTavern_extensions_MiniMaxTTS.md) page for setup instructions.\n- **Novel** - requires a paid NovelAI subscription, generated by NovelAI's TTS engine\n- **OpenAI** - paid API key required, uses OpenAI's TTS models.\n- **Pollinations** - free of charge access to OpenAI TTS models, but with a rate limit. Website (https://pollinations.ai/).\n- **Silero** - free, runs on your PC, quality can vary widely. Requires a dedicated API server (https://github.com/ouoertheo/silero-api-server) installation or Extras API (deprecated).\n- **System** - uses your OS TTS engine, if one exists. Quality can vary widely depending on the OS.\n- **XTTS** - free, requires a dedicated API server installation. See the [XTTS](SillyTavern_extensions_XTTS.md) page for setup instructions.\n\n### Checkboxes\n\n- **Enabled** - turns TTS playback on/off\n- **Auto Generation** - lets TTS start playing automatically when a new message enters the chat\n- **Only narrate \"quotes\"** - Limits TTS playback to only include text within `\"quotation marks\"`. This will `*include \"quotes\" within asterisk lines*` (internal variable name = `narrate_quoted_only`)\n- **Ignore \\*text, even \"quotes\", inside asterisks\\*** - TTS will not play any text within `*asterisks*`, even \"quotes\" (internal variable name = `narrate_dialogues_only`)\n- *having both \"only narrate quotes\" and \"ignore asterisks\" checkboxes both checked will result in the TTS only reading \"quotes\" which are not in asterisks, and ignoring everything else.*\n- **Narrate only the translated text** - this will make the TTS only narrate the translated text.\n\nGiven the example text: `*Cohee approaches you with a faint \"nya\"* \"Good evening, senpai\", she says.`\nHere's a table showing how the text will be modified based on the boolean states of **Ignore \\*text, even \"quotes\", inside asterisks\\*** and **Only narrate \"quotes\"**:\n\n| **Ignore \\*text, even \"quotes\", inside asterisks\\*** \t | **Only narrate \"quotes\"**\t | **Output**                                                                |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------| \n| Disabled                                               | \tDisabled\t                 | Cohee approaches you with a faint \"nya\" \"Good evening, senpai\", she says. |\n| Disabled                                               | Enabled\t                   | \"nya\"... \"Good evening, senpai\"                                           |\n| Enabled\t                                               | Disabled\t                  | \"Good evening, senpai\", she says.                                         |\n| Enabled\t                                               | Enabled\t                   | \"Good evening, senpai\"                                                    |\n\n### Sliders\n\nThese will change depending on the API you select.\n\n### Buttons\n\n- **Apply** - this must be clicked after setting a TTS API and after editing the voice map.\n- **Refresh** - reloads the list of voices from the selected TTS API.\n- **Available voices** - loads a popup with all voices available for your selected API, and lets you preview them with sample dialogues.\n\n## Using TTS\n\n1. Click the \"Enable\" checkbox, or nothing will ever happen.\n2. Click the \"Auto-generation\" checkbox if you want the TTS to start automatically every time a new message arrives in chat.\n3. Optionally, click the megaphone icon inside the top-right of any message to playback on demand.\n4. Click the lower right \"Stop\" button (found inside the wand menu) to stop any playback.\n\n### Voice Map\n\nYou must provide a voice map for the TTS to use, otherwise, it won't know what voices should be used for each character. To setup the voice map, first open a chat with a character that you'd like to assign a voice to and/or select a user persona to assign a voice to, then select a voice listed by a TTS provider from the dropdown. If you don't see a list of voices and/or characters, make sure that your TTS provider is configured correctly and click \"Refresh\". Some providers (like OpenAI-compatible or NovelAI) require you to populate the voice list manually."

    "content": "# VRM\n\nThis guide will walk you through the process of setting up and customizing the VRM extension for your SillyTavern experience. This extension allows you to use VRM animated models for your character, providing a dynamic and interactive element to your virtual character.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you've met the following prerequisites:\n\n1. **Branch Selection**: Make sure you're using the latest version branch of SillyTavern to access the latest features and updates.\n\n2. **Extension Installation**: Install the \"VRM\" extension from the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in the Extensions panel (represented by the stacked blocks icon).\n\n3. **Model Folder Placement**: Place your VRM model files (.vrm) into the `/data/<user-handle>/assets/vrm/model` directory and your animation files into the `/data/<user-handle>/assets/vrm/animation` directory. The currently supported animation file format are .fbx and .bvh that are compatible with VRM models. This include any animation you can get from Mixamo (https://www.mixamo.com/) and any animation you can export from tools like XR Animator (https://github.com/ButzYung/SystemAnimatorOnline).\n\n## Extension Settings\n\nThe VRM extension offers various settings to customize the behavior of your animated model. Here are the key settings:\n\n### Global Settings\n\n1. **Enabled**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to activate the extension, allowing your VRM model to interact within SillyTavern.\n   - You can disable the extension if you want to use normal sprites only.\n\n2. **Look at camera**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to make the VRM model eyes look at the camera.\n\n3. **Blink**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to make the VRM model eyes blink at random intervals. Model expressions should define properly blinking weight property otherwize model can blink with closed eyes for example, if that happens either:\n    - correct the model if you have the .vroid file\n    - don't use that incorrect face experession\n    - disable blinking completly with this checkbox\n\n4. **TTS Lip sync**\n    - Enable this checkbox to have the VRM mouth movement follow the sound of your TTS when it's played. Only work with TTS whose sound is played by Sillytavern itself like XTTS (not in streaming mode). If disabled, mouth will be animated according to the message text length when a new character message is received.\n\n5. **Auto-send Interaction**:\n   - Enable this checkbox to automatically trigger character interactions when you click on areas with mapped messages (refer to the hit areas section for details).\n\n### Performances Settings\n\n1. **Body hitboxes**\n    - Enable this checkbox to activate detection of click on several part of the VRM model depending on the model the following area can be detected: head/chest/hands/groin/butt/legs/feets. Hitboxes location are computed at each frames and follow the body animation, disabling this option can improve performance.\n\n2. **Use model cache**\n    - Enable this checkbox to keep in memory VRM model when switching models, allows to switch back to previous model faster. Usefull if you use different model for the same character to change outfit or form for example. Can affect performance.\n\n3. **Use animation cache**\n    - Enable this checkboxx to keep in memory all animations played during the session. All animation assigned to a model will also be loaded the first time the model appear. Will increase the time you load the model the first time but make all animation switch instant. Can affect performance.\n\n### Debug Settings\n\n1. **Show grid**\n    - Enable this checkbox to visualize the 3d grid, model dragging box and body hitboxes.\n\n2. **Reload button**\n    - Click this button to reload the 3d scene, clear the cache and all VRM models. Use it if some bug occurs or if cache starts to hit performance.\n\n### Scene Settings\n\n1. **Light Color**\n    - Set the color of the light in the 3d scene. Click on the reset button to set it back to the default white color. Depending on your browser you can use a color picker, for example you can color pick the color of your background image to add more immersion.\n\n2. **Light intensity**\n    - Set the light intensity in percent using the slider. Click on the reset button to set it back to the default value of 100%. VRM model can react differently to light depending on the baked shaders into the model, play with the value and see how it goes.\n\n## Character Selection\n\nThese settings allow you to manage characters and assign VRM models to them.\n\n1. **Refresh Button**:\n   - Click the refresh button to update the list of characters in the current chat.\n\n2. **Select Character**:\n   - Use the drop-down list to choose a character to assign a VRM model to.\n\n3. **Remove Button**:\n   - Click this button to delete the assigned model for a character.\n\n## Model Selection\n\n1. **Refresh Button**:\n   - Click the refresh button if your VRM model does not appear in the list.\n\n2. **Select Model**:\n   - Choose a model from the list to assign it to the selected character.\n   - The model has to be located in `/data/<user-handle>/assets/vrm/model` directory.\n\n3. **Reset button**\n    - Click this button to reset the model settings to its default. If you have animation files that correspond to the default value they will be auto mapped. See the naming mapping at the end of this README.\n\n## Model Settings\n\n1. **Model Scale**:\n   - Use the slider to adjust the size of the model, making it larger or smaller.\n\n2. **Model Center X/Y Offset**:\n   - Use those sliders to change the horizontal/vertical position of the model relative to the window center.\n\n3. **Model X/Y Rotation**\n    - Use those sliders to change the horizontal/vertical rotation of the model relative to the model hips.\n\n### Remarks\n    - The settings are saved per model not per character and carry over different chats.\n    - If you want to use the same model for two different characters with different settings make a copy of the .vrm file.\n    - You can also drag the model with your mouse, and those settings will be updated and saved. Left click and hold to drag a model around the screen. Middle mouse Click and hold to rotate the model or use shift-left click. Use mouse wheel with cursor on the model to scale it up or down or use ctrl+left click.\n    - Use these UI settings to bring your model back on the screen if you somehow made it out of view. Also, check the \"Show frame\" checkbox to see clearly where you can click to drag the model.\n\n## Hitboxes mapping\n\n    - Depending on the model bones definition some hitboxes area can be generated, they will be listed in this part of the ui, and you can assign an expression/animation/message to each of them that will trigger when you click the area.\n\n## Classified Expressions Mapping\n\n1. **Requirements**\n    - Requires the use of the classify expression extension; otherwise, it will fallback to the default animation.\n\n2. **Mapping**\n    - For each detected emotion by the classify extension, you can assign an expression/motion/message. The message can contain commands.\n\n## Commands\n\n1. **/vrmlightcolor**\n    - set the light color\n    - arguments: color\n    - example: \"/vrmlightcolor white\" or \"/vrmlightcolor purple\".\n2. **/vrmlightintensity**\n    - set the light intensity in percent\n    - arguments: intensity\n    - example: \"/vrmlightintensity 0\" or \"/vrmlightintensity 100\n3. **/vrmmodel**\n    - assign the vrm model to the character\n    - arguments: character, model\n    - example: \"/vrmmodel Seraphina.vrm\" in solo chat or \"/vrmmodel character=Seraphina model=Seraphina.vrm\" in group chat\n4. **/vrmexpression**\n    - change the expression of the model\n    - arguments: character, expression\n    - example: \"/vrmexpression happy\" in solo chat or \"/vrmexpression character=Seraphina expression=happy\" in group chat\n\n5. **/vrmmotion**\n    - change the animation of the model\n    - arguments: character, motion, loop, random\n    - \"/vrmmotion idle\" or \"/vrmmotion character=Seraphina motion=idle loop=true random=false\"\n\n## Animations default mapping\nIf your animation file are named in the following way they will be mapped automatically when reseting a model settings. For example the files named \"assets/vrm/animation/neutral.bvh\" and \"assets/vrm/animation/neutral1.fbx\" will be automatically mapped as a group for default and neutral classified animation. Same goes for the hitboxes. \n\n    // Fallback\n    \"default\": \"assets/vrm/animation/neutral\",\n\n    // Classify class\n    \"admiration\": \"assets/vrm/animation/admiration\",\n    \"amusement\": \"assets/vrm/animation/amusement\",\n    \"anger\": \"assets/vrm/animation/anger\",\n    \"annoyance\": \"assets/vrm/animation/annoyance\",\n    \"approval\": \"assets/vrm/animation/approval\",\n    \"caring\": \"assets/vrm/animation/caring\",\n    \"confusion\": \"assets/vrm/animation/confusion\",\n    \"curiosity\": \"assets/vrm/animation/curiosity\",\n    \"desire\": \"assets/vrm/animation/desire\",\n    \"disappointment\": \"assets/vrm/animation/disappointment\",\n    \"disapproval\": \"assets/vrm/animation/disapproval\",\n    \"disgust\": \"assets/vrm/animation/disgust\",\n    \"embarrassment\": \"assets/vrm/animation/embarrassment\",\n    \"excitement\": \"assets/vrm/animation/excitement\",\n    \"fear\": \"assets/vrm/animation/fear\",\n    \"gratitude\": \"assets/vrm/animation/gratitude\",\n    \"grief\": \"assets/vrm/animation/grief\",\n    \"joy\": \"assets/vrm/animation/joy\",\n    \"love\": \"assets/vrm/animation/love\",\n    \"nervousness\": \"assets/vrm/animation/nervousness\",\n    \"neutral\": \"assets/vrm/animation/neutral\",\n    \"optimism\": \"assets/vrm/animation/optimism\",\n    \"pride\": \"assets/vrm/animation/pride\",\n    \"realization\": \"assets/vrm/animation/realization\",\n    \"relief\": \"assets/vrm/animation/relief\",\n    \"remorse\": \"assets/vrm/animation/remorse\",\n    \"sadness\": \"assets/vrm/animation/sadness\",\n    \"surprise\": \"assets/vrm/animation/surprise\",\n\n    // Hitboxes\n    \"head\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_head\",\n    \"chest\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_chest\",\n    \"groin\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_groin\",\n    \"butt\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_butt\",\n    \"leftHand\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_hands\",\n    \"rightHand\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_hands\",\n    \"leftLeg\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_leg\",\n    \"rightLeg\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_leg\",\n    \"rightFoot\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_foot\",\n    \"leftFoot\": \"assets/vrm/animation/hitarea_foot\"\n\nThank you for following this guide! Your SillyTavern experience is now enriched with animated and interactive 3D models.\n\n## Remarks\n    - The VRM model loaded by this extension are the .vrm files not the .vroid files.\n    - Animation files should be VRM compatible, you can use a tool like XR animation (https://github.com/ButzYung/SystemAnimatorOnline) to convert fbx/bvh animation file.\n    - You can create animation groups by having file with same name ending with different numbers for example: \"idle1.bvh\", \"idle2.bhv\", \"idle3.bvh\" will be considered as one group \"idle\" and when selected in a mapping a random one will played when triggered, can be use to add variety to animations.\n    - You can get curated animations from this repository: https://github.com/test157t/VRM-Animations-Pack-For-Silly-Tavern\n    - Nitral has some tutorial video about how to use the extension and the animation repo: https://www.youtube.com/@nitralai"

In this case, this extension will be largely redundant. Check the **<i class=\"fa-solid fa-sliders\"></i>\u00a0AI Response Configuration** panel for the \"Enable web search\" toggle. For example, this is available for Claude, Google AI Studio / Vertex AI, xAI, and OpenRouter backends.\n\n**## Available sources**\n\n### Selenium Plugin\n\nRequires an official server plugin to be installed and enabled.\n\nSee SillyTavern-WebSearch-Selenium (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-WebSearch-Selenium) for more details.\n\nSupports Google and DuckDuckGo engines.\n\n### Extras API\n\nRequires a `websearch` module and Chrome/Firefox web browser installed on the host machine.\n\nSupports Google and DuckDuckGo engines.\n\n### SerpApi\n\nRequires an API key.\n\nGet the key here: <https://serpapi.com/dashboard>\n\n### SearXNG\n\nRequires a SearXNG instance URL (either private or public). Uses HTML format for search results.\n\nSearXNG preferences string: obtained from SearXNG - preferences - COOKIES - Copy preferences hash\n\nLearn more: <https://docs.searxng.org/>\n\n### Tavily AI\n\nRequires an API key.\n\nGet the key here: <https://app.tavily.com/>\n\n### KoboldCpp\n\nKoboldCpp URL must be provided in Text Completion API settings. KoboldCpp version must be >= 1.81.1 and WebSearch module must be enabled on startup: enable Network => Enable WebSearch in the GUI launcher or add `--websearch` to the command line.\n\nSee: <https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases/tag/v1.81.1>\n\n### Serper\n\nRequires an API key.\n\nGet the key here: <https://serper.dev/>\n\n### Z.AI\n\nRequires an API key, set it in the Chat Completion API settings first. Not compatible with the Coding API subscription!\n\nGet the key here: <https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list/>\n\nDocs: <https://docs.z.ai/api-reference/tools/web-search>\n\n## How to use\n\n1. Make sure you use the latest version of SillyTavern.\n2. Install the extension via the \"Download Extensions & Assets\" menu in SillyTavern.\n3. Open the \"Web Search\" extension settings, set your API key or connect to Extras, and enable the extension.\n4. The web search results will be added to the prompt organically as you chat. **Only user messages trigger the search.**\n5. To include search results more organically, wrap search queries with single backticks: ```Tell me about the `latest Ryan Gosling movie`.``` will produce a search query `latest Ryan Gosling movie`.\n6. Optionally, configure the settings to your liking.\n\n## Settings\n\n### General\n\n1. Enabled - toggles the extension on and off.\n2. Sources = sets the search results source.\n3. Cache Lifetime - how long (in seconds) the search results are cached for your prompt. Default = one week.\n\n### Prompt Settings\n\n1. Prompt Budget - sets the maximum capacity of the inserted text (in characters of text, NOT tokens). Rule of thumb: 1 token ~ 3-4 characters, adjust according to your model's context limits. Default = 1500 characters.\n2. Insertion Template - how the result gets inserted into the prompt. Supports the usual macro + special macro: \\{\\{query\\}\\} for search query and \\{\\{text\\}\\} for search results.\n3. Injection Position - where the result goes in the prompt. The same options as for the Author's Note: as in-chat injection or before/after system prompt.\n\n### Search Activation\n\n1. Use function tool - uses [function calling](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_Function-Calling.md) to activate search or scrape web pages. Must use a supported Chat Completion API and be enabled in the AI Response settings. **Disables all other activation methods when engaged.**\n2. Use Backticks - enables search activation using words encased in single backticks.\n3. Use Trigger Phrases - enables search activation using trigger phrases.\n4. Regular expressions - provide a JS-flavored regex to match the user message. If the regex matches, the search with a given query will be triggered. Search query supports `{{macros}}` and $1-syntax to reference the matched group. Example: `/what is happening in (.*)/i` regex for search query `news in $1` will match a message containing `what is happening in New York` and trigger the search with the query `news in New York`.\n5. Trigger Phrases - add phrases that will trigger the search, one by one. It can be anywhere in the message, and the query starts from the trigger word and spans to \"Max Words\" total. To exclude a specific message from processing, it must start with a period, e.g. `.What do you think?`. Priority of triggers: first by order in the textbox, then the first one in the user message.\n6. Max Words - how many words are included in the search query (including the trigger phrase). Google has a limit of about 32 words per prompt. Default = 10 words.\n\n### Page Scraping\n\n1. Visit Links - text will be extracted from the visited search result pages and saved to a file attachment.\n2. Visit Count - how many links will be visited and parsed for text.\n3. Visit Domain Blacklist - site domains to be excluded from visiting. One per line.\n4. File Header - file header template, inserted at the start of the text file, has an additional \\{\\{query\\}\\} macro.\n5. Block Header - link block template, inserted with the parsed content of every link. Use \\{\\{link\\}\\} macro for page URL and \\{\\{text\\}\\} for page content.\n6. Save Target - where to save the results of scraping. Possible options: trigger message attachments, or chat attachments of Data Bank, or just images (if the source supports them).\n7. Include Images - attach relevant images to the chat. Requires a source that supports images (see below).\n\n## More info\n\nSearch results from the latest query will stay included in the prompt until the next valid query is found.\nIf you want to ask additional questions without accidentally triggering the search, start your message with a period.\n\nWeb Search function tool always overrides other triggers if enabled and available.\n\n**Priority of triggers (if multiple are enabled):**\n\n1. Backticks.\n2. Regular expressions.\n3. Trigger phrases.\n\nTo discard all previous queries from processing, start the user message with an exclamation mark, for example, a user message `!Now let's talk about...` will discard this and every message above it.\n\nThis extension also provides a `/websearch` slash command to use in STscript. More info here: [STscript Language Reference](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md)\n\n```stscript\n/websearch (links=on|off snippets=on|off [query]) \u2013 performs a web search query.

    "content": "# XTTS with voice cloning\n\nGreetings! So, you've been blown away by those Reddit posts showcasing how far the technology went for the AI text-to-speech?\n\nFeeling excited to give your robotic waifu/husbando a new shiny voice modulator?\n\nFear not, this stunning groundbreaking technology is already available at your local SillyTavern, you just need a simple...\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Latest version of SillyTavern.\n2. Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) installed.\n3. (Windows) Visual C++ Build Tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) installed.\n4. WAV files with voice clips to clone from (~10 seconds per file). File requirements: PCM, Mono, 22050Hz, 16-bit (convert via Audacity).\n5. Create a folder with \"speakers\" and \"output\" subfolders. Put WAV files into \"speakers\".\n\nExample folder structure:\n```\nC:\\xtts\n  - speakers\n    - alice.wav\n    - bob.wav\n  - output\n```\n\n## Installing \n\ndaswer123 (https://github.com/daswer123) made an API server that runs the XTTSv2 model on your computer and connects to SillyTavern's TTS extension.\n\nIt's completely independent of Extras API and would use a separate environment.\n\n**Very important:** Don't install the following requirements to your Extras environment or system Python.\nIt will break your other packages, do unnecessary downgrades, etc.\n\nThe following instruction is provided using Miniconda, but you can also do it with venv (not covered here).\nOpen the Anaconda command prompt and follow the instructions line by line.\n\n### Getting the server up and running\n\n1. Navigate to the folder you've created at step 4 of prerequisites.\n    ```\n    cd C:\\xtts\n    ```\n2. Create a new conda env. From now on, we'll call it `xtts`.\n    ```\n    conda create -n xtts\n    ```\n3. Activate a newly created env.\n    ```\n    conda activate xtts\n    ```\n4. Install Python 3.10 to your env. Confirm with \"y\" when prompted.\n    ```\n    conda install python=3.10\n    ```\n5. Install the XTTS server with its requirements.\n    ```\n    pip install xtts-api-server pydub\n    ```\n6. Install PyTorch. This can take some time. The following line installs PyTorch with GPU acceleration support (CUDA).\nIf you want to use just the CPU inference, drop the last part that starts with `--index-url`.\n    ```\n    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\n    ```\n7. Start the XTTS server on the default host and port: <http://localhost:8020>\n    ```\n    python -m xtts_api_server\n    ```\n8. During your first startup, the model will be downloaded (about ~2 GB).\nDon't forget to read the legal notice from Coqui AI very carefully. Lol, I'm kidding, just hit \"y\" again.\n\n### Connecting to SillyTavern\n\n1. Open the extensions panel, expand the TTS menu, and pick \"XTTSv2\" in the provider list.\n2. Choose your text-to-speech language in the Language dropdown (I'll be sad if it's not Polish).\n3. Verify that the provider endpoint points to <http://localhost:8020> and \"Available voices\" shows a list of your voice samples.\n4. Pick any character and set a mapping between the voice sample and the character.\nIf the characters list is empty, hit \"Reload\" a couple of times.\n5. Configure the rest of the TTS settings according to your preferences.\n\n### You're all set now!\n\nClick on the bullhorn icon in the context actions menu for any message and hear the beautiful cloned voice emanating\nfrom your speakers. The generation takes some time and it's not real-time even on high-end RTX GPUs.\n\n### Streaming?\n\nIt's possible to use HTTP streaming with the latest version of the XTTS server to get the chunks of generated audio as soon as it is available!\n\n#### This doesn't work with RVC!\n\nThe audio will still be generated (assuming you're using the latest version of the RVC extension) and converted, *but not streamed* as RVC requires to have the full audio file before initiating the conversion. Streamed RVC is still being investigated...\n\n#### How to get streaming support?\n\n1. Update SillyTavern to the latest version.\n2. Update the XTTS server to the latest version.\n\n    ```bash\n    conda activate xtts\n    pip install xtts-api-server --upgrade\n    ```\n\n3. Start and connect XTTS to ST as usual.\n4. Enable the \"Streaming\" XTTS extension setting in SillyTavern.\n\n### Choppy audio?\n\nTry increasing the \"chunk size\" setting.\n\nFor reference: with a chunk size of 200, RTX 3090 can produce uninterrupted audio at the cost of slightly increased audio latency.\n\n### How to restart the TTS server?\n\nJust do steps 1, 3 and 7 from the installation instruction.\n\n### Android??\n\nUnlikely, it can't run apps that require PyTorch without some arcane black magic that we don't provide support for. You can try it out at your own risk, but no support will be provided if you face any problems.\n\nYour best solution is to host the TTS API on your PC over the local network, just don't forget to specify the host and port to listen on - see README (https://github.com/daswer123/xtts-api-server/blob/main/README.md)."

    "content": "# UI Extensions\n\nUI extensions expand SillyTavern's functionality by hooking into its events and API. They run in a browser context and have practically unrestricted access to the DOM, JavaScript APIs, and the SillyTavern context. Extensions can modify the UI, call internal APIs, and interact with chat data. This guide explains how to create your own extensions (JavaScript knowledge is required).\n\n**Just want to install extensions?**\n\nGo here: [Extensions](SillyTavern_extensions_index.md).\n\n**To extend the functionality of the Node.js server, see the [Server Plugins](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_Server-Plugins.md) page.**\n\n**Can't write JavaScript?**\n\n* Consider [STscript](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_st-script.md) as a simpler alternative to writing a full-fledged extension.\n* Go through the MDN Course (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) and come back when you're done.\n\n## Extension submissions\n\nWant to contribute your extensions to the official content repository (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-Content)? Contact us!\n\nTo ensure that all extensions are safe and easy to use, we have a few requirements:\n\n1. Your extension must be open-source and have a libre license (see Choose a License (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)). If you are unsure, AGPLv3 is a good choice.\n2. Extensions must be compatible with the latest release version of SillyTavern. Please be ready to update your extension if something in the core changes.\n3. Extensions must be well-documented. This includes a README file with installation instructions, usage examples, and a list of features.\n4. Extensions that have a server plugin requirement to function will not be accepted.\n\n## Examples\n\nSee live examples of simple SillyTavern extensions:\n\n* <https://github.com/city-unit/st-extension-example> - basic extension template. Showcases manifest creation, local script imports, adding a settings UI panel, and persistent extension settings usage.\n* <https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aextension+org%3ASillyTavern&type=Repositories> - a list of all official SillyTavern extensions on GitHub.\n\n## Bundling\n\nExtensions can also utilize bundling to isolate themselves from the rest of the modules and use any dependencies from NPM, including UI frameworks like Vue, React, etc.\n\n* <https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-WebpackTemplate> - template repository of an extension using TypeScript and Webpack (no React).\n* <https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-ReactTemplate> - template repository of a bare-bones extension using React and Webpack.\n\nTo use relative imports from the bundle, you may need to create an import wrapper. Here's an example for Webpack:\n\n```js\n/**\n * Import a member from a module by URL, bypassing webpack.\n * @param {string} url URL to import from\n * @param {string} what Name of the member to import\n * @param {any} defaultValue Fallback value\n * @returns {Promise<any>} Imported member\n */\nexport async function importFromUrl(url, what, defaultValue = null) {\n    try {\n        const module = await import(/* webpackIgnore: true */ url);\n        if (!Object.hasOwn(module, what)) {\n            throw new Error(`No ${what} in module`);\n        }\n        return module[what];\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(`Failed to import ${what} from ${url}: ${error}`);\n        return defaultValue;\n     }\n}\n\n// Import a function from 'script.js' module\nconst generateRaw = await importFromUrl('/script.js', 'generateRaw');\n```\n\n## manifest.json\n\nEvery extension must have a folder in `data/<user-handle>/extensions` and a `manifest.json` file, which contains metadata about the extension and a path to a JS script file that is the entry point of the extension.\n\nDownloadable extensions are mounted into the `/scripts/extensions/third-party` folder when serving over HTTP, so relative imports should be used based on that. To ease local development, consider placing your extension repository in the `/scripts/extensions/third-party` folder (the \"Install for all users\" option).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"display_name\": \"The name of the extension\",\n    \"loading_order\": 1,\n    \"requires\": [],\n    \"optional\": [],\n    \"dependencies\": [],\n    \"js\": \"index.js\",\n    \"css\": \"style.css\",\n    \"author\": \"Your name\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"homePage\": \"https://github.com/your/extension\",\n    \"auto_update\": true,\n    \"minimum_client_version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"i18n\": {\n        \"de-de\": \"i18n/de-de.json\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Manifest fields\n\n* `display_name` is required. It is displayed in the \"Manage Extensions\" menu.\n* `loading_order` is optional. A higher number loads later.\n* `js` is the main JS file reference and is required.\n* `css` is an optional style file reference.\n* `author` is required. It should contain the name or contact info of the author(s).\n* `auto_update` is set to `true` if the extension should auto-update when the version of the ST package changes.\n* `i18n` is an optional object that specifies the supported locales and their corresponding JSON files (see below).\n* `dependencies` is an optional array of strings specifying other **extensions** that this extension depends on.\n* `generate_interceptor` is an optional string that specifies the name of a global function called on text generation requests.\n* `minimum_client_version` is an optional string that specifies the minimum SillyTavern version required for this extension to work.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nExtensions can also depend on other SillyTavern extensions. The extension will not load if any of these dependencies are missing or disabled.\n\nDependencies are specified by their **folder name** as it appears in the `public/extensions` directory.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Built-in extensions: `\"vectors\"`, `\"caption\"`\n* Third-party extensions: `\"third-party/Extension-WebLLM\"`, `\"third-party/Extension-Mermaid\"`\n\n### Deprecated fields\n\n* `requires` is an optional array of strings specifying required **Extras modules**. The extension won't be loaded if the connected Extras API doesn't provide all listed modules.\n* `optional` is an optional array of strings specifying optional **Extras modules**. The extension will still load if these are missing, and the extension should handle their absence gracefully.\n\nTo check which modules are currently provided by the connected Extras API, import the `modules` array from `scripts/extensions.js`.\n\n## Scripting\n\n### Using getContext\n\nThe `getContext()` function in the `SillyTavern` global object gives you access to the SillyTavern context, which is a collection of all the main app state objects, useful functions, and utilities.\n\n```js\nconst context = SillyTavern.getContext();\ncontext.chat; // Chat log - MUTABLE\ncontext.characters; // Character list\ncontext.characterId; // Index of the current character\ncontext.groups; // Group list\ncontext.groupId; // ID of the current group\n// And many more...\n```\n\nYou can find the full list of available properties and functions in the SillyTavern source code (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/staging/public/scripts/st-context.js).\n\n**If you're missing any of the functions/properties in `getContext`, please get in touch with the developers or send us a pull request!**\n\n**### Shared libraries**\n\nMost of the npm libraries used internally by the SillyTavern frontend are shared in the `libs` property of the `SillyTavern` global object.\n\n* `lodash` - Utility library. Docs (https://lodash.com/).\n* `localforage` - Browser storage library. Docs (https://localforage.github.io/localForage/).\n* `Fuse` - Fuzzy search library. Docs (https://www.fusejs.io/).\n* `DOMPurify` - HTML sanitization library. Docs (https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).\n* `Handlebars` - Templating library. Docs (https://handlebarsjs.com/).\n* `moment` - Date/time manipulation library. Docs (http://momentjs.com/).\n* `showdown` - Markdown converter library. Docs (https://showdownjs.com/).\n\nYou can find the full list of exported libraries in the SillyTavern source code (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/staging/public/lib.js).\n\n**Example:** Using the DOMPurify library.\n\n```js\nconst { DOMPurify } = SillyTavern.libs;\n\nconst sanitizedHtml = DOMPurify.sanitize('<script>\"dirty HTML\"</script>');\n```\n\n### TypeScript notice\n\nIf you want access to autocomplete for all methods in the `SillyTavern` global object (and you probably do), including `getContext()` and `libs`, you should add a TypeScript `.d.ts` module declaration. This declaration should import global types from SillyTavern's source, depending on your extension's location. Below is an example that works for both installation types: \"all users\" and \"current user.\"\n\n**global.d.ts** - place this file in the root of your extension directory (next to `manifest.json`):\n\n```ts\nexport {};\n\n// 1. Import for user-scoped extensions\nimport '../../../../public/global';\n// 2. Import for server-scoped extensions\nimport '../../../../global';\n\n// Define additional types if needed...\ndeclare global {\n    // Add global type declarations here\n}\n```\n\n### Importing from other files\n\nUsing imports from SillyTavern code is unreliable and can break at any time if the internal structure of ST's modules changes. `getContext` provides a more stable API.\n\n**Unless you're building a bundled extension, you can import variables and functions from other JS files.**\n\nFor example, this code snippet will generate a reply from the currently selected API in the background:\n\n```js\nimport { generateQuietPrompt } from \"../../../../script.js\";\n\nasync function handleMessage(data) {\n    const text = data.message;\n    const translated = await generateQuietPrompt({ quietPrompt: text });\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## State management\n\n### Persistent settings\n\nWhen an extension needs to persist its state, it can use the `extensionSettings` object from the `getContext()` function to store and retrieve data. An extension can store any JSON-serializable data in the settings object and must use a unique key to avoid conflicts with other extensions.\n\nTo persist the settings, use the `saveSettingsDebounced()` function, which will save the settings to the server.\n\n```js\nconst { extensionSettings, saveSettingsDebounced } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Define a unique identifier for your extension\nconst MODULE_NAME = 'my_extension';\n\n// Define default settings\nconst defaultSettings = Object.freeze({\n    enabled: false,\n    option1: 'default',\n    option2: 5\n});\n\n// Define a function to get or initialize settings\nfunction getSettings() {\n    // Initialize settings if they don't exist\n    if (!extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME]) {\n        extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME] = structuredClone(defaultSettings);\n    }\n\n    // Ensure all default keys exist (helpful after updates)\n    for (const key of Object.keys(defaultSettings)) {\n        if (!Object.hasOwn(extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME], key)) {\n            extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME][key] = defaultSettings[key];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME];\n}\n\n// Use the settings\nconst settings = getSettings();\nsettings.option1 = 'new value';\n\n// Save the settings\nsaveSettingsDebounced();\n```\n\n### Chat metadata\n\nTo bind some data to a specific chat, you can use the `chatMetadata` object from the `getContext()` function. This object allows you to store arbitrary data associated with a chat, which can be useful for storing extension-specific state.\n\nTo persist the metadata, use the `saveMetadata()` function, which will save the metadata to the server.\n\nDo not save the reference to `chatMetadata` in a long-lived variable, as the reference will change when the chat is switched. Always use `SillyTavern.getContext().chatMetadata` to access the current chat metadata.\n\n```js\n\nconst { chatMetadata, saveMetadata } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Set some metadata for the current chat\nchatMetadata['my_key'] = 'my_value';\n\n// Get the metadata for the current chat\nconst value = chatMetadata['my_key'];\n\n// Save the metadata to the server\nawait saveMetadata();\n```\n\nThe `CHAT_CHANGED` event is emitted when the chat is switched, so you can listen to this event to update your extension's state accordingly. See more in the [Listening to events](SillyTavern_For_Contributors.md) section.\n\n**### Character cards**\n\nSillyTavern fully supports Character Cards V2 Specification (https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2/blob/main/spec_v2.md), which allows to store arbitrary data in the character card JSON data.\n\nThis is useful for extensions that need to store additional data associated with the character and make it shareable when exporting the character card.\n\nTo write data to the character card extensions (https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2/blob/main/spec_v2.md#extensions) data field, use the `writeExtensionField` function from the `getContext()` function. This function takes a character ID, a string key, and a value to write. The value must be JSON-serializable.\n\n**Weirdness Ahead**\n\nDespite being called `characterId`, it's not a \"real\" unique identifier but rather an index of the character in the `characters` array.\n\nThe index of the current character is provided by the `characterId` property in the context. If you want to write data to the currently selected character, use `SillyTavern.getContext().characterId`. If you need to store data for another character, find the index by searching for the character in the `characters` array.\n\n**Caution: `characterId` is `undefined` in group chats or when no character is selected!**\n\n```js\n\nconst { writeExtensionField, characterId } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Write some data to the character card\nawait writeExtensionField(characterId, 'my_extension_key', {\n    someData: 'value',\n    anotherData: 42\n});\n\n// Read the data back from the character card\nconst character = SillyTavern.getContext().characters[characterId];\n// The data is stored in the `extensions` object of the character's data\nconst myData = character.data?.extensions?.my_extension_key;\n```\n\n### Settings presets\n\nArbitrary JSON data can be stored in the settings presets of the main API types. It will be exported and imported along with the preset JSON, so you can use it to store extension-specific settings for the preset. The following API types support data extensions in settings presets:\n\n* Chat Completion\n* Text Completion\n* NovelAI\n* KoboldAI / AI Horde\n\nTo read or write the data, you first need to get the PresetManager instance from the context:\n\n```js\nconst { getPresetManager } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Get the preset manager for the current API type\nconst pm = getPresetManager();\n\n// Write data to the preset extension field:\n// - path: the path to the field in the preset data\n// - value: the value to write\n// - name (optional): the name of the preset to write to, defaults to the currently selected preset\nawait pm.writePresetExtensionField({ path: 'hello', value: 'world' });\n\n// Read data from the preset extension field:\n// - path: the path to the field in the preset data\n// - name (optional): the name of the preset to read from, defaults to the currently selected preset\nconst value = pm.readPresetExtensionField({ path: 'hello' });\n```\n\nThe `PRESET_CHANGED` and `MAIN_API_CHANGED` events are emitted when the preset is changed or the main API is switched, so you can listen to these events to update your extension's state accordingly. See more in the [Listening to events](SillyTavern_For_Contributors.md) section.\n\n**## Internationalization**\n\n**For general information on providing translations, see the [Internationalization](SillyTavern_For_Contributors_i18n.md) page.**\n\n**Extensions can provide additional localized strings for use with the `t`, `translate` functions and the `data-i18n` attribute in HTML templates.**\n\nSee the list of supported locales here (`lang` key): <https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/public/locales/lang.json>\n\n### Direct `addLocaleData` call\n\nPass a locale code and an object with the translations to the `addLocaleData` function. Overrides of existing keys are *NOT* allowed. If the passed locale code is not a currently chosen locale, the data will be silently ignored.\n\n```js\nSillyTavern.getContext().addLocaleData('fr-fr', { 'Hello': 'Bonjour' });\nSillyTavern.getContext().addLocaleData('de-de', { 'Hello': 'Hallo' });\n```\n\n### Via the extension manifest\n\nAdd an i18n object with a list of supported locales and their corresponding JSON file paths (relative to your extension's directory) to the manifest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"display_name\": \"Foobar\",\n  \"js\": \"index.js\",\n  // rest of the fields\n  \"i18n\": {\n    \"fr-fr\": \"i18n/french.json\",\n    \"de-de\": \"i18n/german.json\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Registering slash commands (new way)\n\nWhile `registerSlashCommand` still exists for backward compatibility, new slash commands should now be registered through `SlashCommandParser.addCommandObject()` to provide extended details about the command and its parameters to the parser (and, in turn, to autocomplete and the command help).\n\n```javascript\nSlashCommandParser.addCommandObject(SlashCommand.fromProps({ name: 'repeat',\n    callback: (namedArgs, unnamedArgs) => {\n        return Array(namedArgs.times ?? 5)\n            .fill(unnamedArgs.toString())\n            .join(isTrueBoolean(namedArgs.space.toString()) ?

UI modifications can be done here. It will auto-fire every time a new listener is attached after the app is initialized.\n* `APP_READY`: the app is fully loaded and ready to use. It will auto-fire every time a new listener is attached after the app is ready.\n* `MESSAGE_RECEIVED`: the LLM message is generated and recorded into the `chat` object but not yet rendered in the UI.\n* `MESSAGE_SENT`: the message is sent by the user and recorded into the `chat` object but not yet rendered in the UI.\n* `USER_MESSAGE_RENDERED`: the message sent by a user is rendered in the UI.\n* `CHARACTER_MESSAGE_RENDERED`: the generated LLM message is rendered in the UI.\n* `CHAT_CHANGED`: the chat has been switched (e.g., switched to another character, or another chat was loaded).\n* `GENERATION_AFTER_COMMANDS`: the generation is about to start after processing slash commands.\n* `GENERATION_STOPPED`: the generation was stopped by the user.\n* `GENERATION_ENDED`: the generation has been completed or has errored out.\n* `SETTINGS_UPDATED`: the application settings have been updated.\n\nThe rest can be found in the source (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/staging/public/scripts/events.js).\n\n**Event data**\n\nThe way each event passes its data to the listener is not uniform. Some events don't emit any data; some pass an object or a primitive value. Please refer to the source code where the event is emitted to see what data it passes, or check with the debugger.\n\n**### Emitting events**\n\nYou can produce any application events from extensions, including custom events, by calling `eventSource.emit(eventType, ...eventData)`:\n\n```js\nconst { eventSource } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Can be a built-in event_types field or any string.\nconst eventType = 'myCustomEvent';\n\n// Use `await` to ensure all event handlers complete before continuing execution.\nawait eventSource.emit(eventType, { data: 'custom event data' });\n```\n\n## Prompt Interceptors\n\nPrompt Interceptors provide a way for extensions to perform any activity such as modifying the chat data, adding injections, or aborting the generation before a text generation request is made.\n\nInterceptors from different extensions are run sequentially. The order is determined by the `loading_order` field in their respective `manifest.json` files. Extensions with lower `loading_order` values run earlier. If `loading_order` is not specified, `display_name` is used as a fallback. If neither is specified, the order is undefined.\n\n### Registering an Interceptor\n\nTo define a prompt interceptor, add a `generate_interceptor` field to your extension's `manifest.json` file. The value should be the name of a global function that will be called by SillyTavern.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"display_name\": \"My Interceptor Extension\",\n    \"loading_order\": 10, // Affects execution order\n    \"generate_interceptor\": \"myCustomInterceptorFunction\",\n    // ... other manifest properties\n}\n```\n\n### Interceptor Function\n\nThe `generate_interceptor` function is a global function that will be called upon generation requests that are not dry runs. It must be defined in the global scope (e.g., `globalThis.myCustomInterceptorFunction = async function(...) { ... }`) and can return a `Promise` if it needs to perform any asynchronous operations.\n\nThe interceptor function receives the following arguments:\n\n* `chat`: An array of message objects representing the chat history that will be used for prompt building. You can modify this array directly (e.g., add, remove, or alter messages). Please note that messages are mutable, so any changes you make to the array will be reflected in the actual chat history. If you want the changes to be ephemeral, use `structuredClone` to create a deep copy of the message object.\n* `contextSize`: A number indicating the current context size (in tokens) calculated for the upcoming generation.\n* `abort`: A function that, when called, will signal to prevent the text generation from proceeding. It accepts a boolean parameter that prevents any subsequent interceptors from running if `true`.\n* `type`: A string indicating the type or trigger of the generation (e.g., `'quiet'`, `'regenerate'`, `'impersonate'`, `'swipe'`, etc.). This helps the interceptor apply logic conditionally based on how the generation was initiated.\n\n**Example Implementation:**\n\n```javascript\nglobalThis.myCustomInterceptorFunction = async function(chat, contextSize, abort, type) {\n    // Example: Add a system note before the last user message\n    const systemNote = {\n        is_user: false,\n        name: \"System Note\",\n        send_date: Date.now(),\n        mes: \"This was added by my extension!\"\n    };\n    // Insert before the last message\n    chat.splice(chat.length - 1, 0, systemNote);\n}\n```\n\n## Generating text\n\nSillyTavern provides several functions to generate text in different contexts using the currently chosen LLM API. These functions allow you to generate text in the context of a chat, raw generation without any context, or with structured outputs.\n\n### Within a chat context\n\nThe `generateQuietPrompt()` function is used to generate text in the context of a chat with an added \"quiet\" prompt (post-history instruction) in the background (the output is not rendered in the UI). This is useful for generating text without interrupting the user experience while also keeping the relevant chat and character data intact, such as generating a summary or an image prompt.\n\n```js\nconst { generateQuietPrompt } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\nconst quietPrompt = 'Generate a summary of the chat history.';\n\nconst result = await generateQuietPrompt({\n    quietPrompt,\n});\n```\n\n### Raw generation\n\nThe `generateRaw()` function is used to generate text without any chat context. It is useful when you want to fully control the prompt-building process.\n\nIt accepts a `prompt` as a Text Completion string or an array of Chat Completion objects, constructing the request with an appropriate format depending on the selected API type, e.g., converting between chat/text modes, applying instruct formatting, etc. You can also pass an additional `systemPrompt` and a `prefill` to the function for even more control over the generation process.\n\n```js\nconst { generateRaw } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\nconst systemPrompt = 'You are a helpful assistant.';\nconst prompt = 'Generate a story about a brave knight.';\nconst prefill = 'Once upon a time,';\n\n/*\nIn Chat Completion mode, will produce a prompt like this:\n[\n  {role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.'},\n  {role: 'user', content: 'Generate a story about a brave knight.'},\n  {role: 'assistant', content: 'Once upon a time,'}\n]\n*/\n\n/*\nIn Text Completion mode (no instruct), will produce a prompt like this:\n\"You are a helpful assistant.\\nGenerate a story about a brave knight.\\nOnce upon a time,\"\n*/\n\nconst result = await generateRaw({\n    systemPrompt,\n    prompt,\n    prefill,\n});\n```\n\n### Structured Outputs\n\nCurrently only supported by the Chat Completion API. The availability varies based on the selected source and model. If the selected model does not support structured outputs, the generation will either fail or will return an empty object (`'{}'`). Check the documentation for the specific API you are using to see if structured outputs are supported.\n\n**You can use the structured outputs feature to ensure the model produces a valid JSON object that adheres to a provided JSON Schema (https://json-schema.org/learn). This is useful for extensions that require structured data, such as state tracking, data classification, etc.**\n\nTo use structured outputs, you must pass a JSON schema object to `generateRaw()` or `generateQuietPrompt()`. The model will then generate a response that matches the schema, and it will be returned as a stringified JSON object.\n\nThe outputs are not validated against the schema, you must handle the parsing and validation of the generated output yourself. If the model fails to generate a valid JSON object, the function will return an empty object (`'{}'`).\n\nZod (https://zod.dev/json-schema) is a popular library to generate and validate JSON schemas. Its use will not be covered here.\n\n```js\n\nconst { generateRaw, generateQuietPrompt } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Define a JSON schema for the expected output\nconst jsonSchema = {\n    // Required: a name for the schema\n    name: 'StoryStateModel',\n    // Optional: a description of the schema\n    description: 'A schema for a story state with location, plans, and memories.',\n    // Optional:  the schema will be used in strict mode, meaning that only the fields defined in the schema will be allowed\n    strict: true,\n    // Required: a definition of the schema\n    value: {\n        '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#',\n        'type': 'object',\n        'properties': {\n            'location': {\n                'type': 'string'\n            },\n            'plans': {\n                'type': 'string'\n            },\n            'memories': {\n                'type': 'string'\n            }\n        },\n        'required': [\n            'location',\n            'plans',\n            'memories'\n        ],\n    },\n};\n\nconst prompt = 'Generate a story state with location, plans, and memories. Output as a JSON object.';\n\nconst rawResult = await generateRaw({\n    prompt,\n    jsonSchema,\n});\n\nconst quietResult = await generateQuietPrompt({\n    quietPrompt: prompt,\n    jsonSchema,\n});\n```\n\n## Registering custom macros\n\nYou can register custom macros that can be used anywhere where macro substitutions are supported, e.g. in the character card fields, STscript commands, prompt templates, etc.\n\nTo register a macro, use the `registerMacro()` function from the `SillyTavern.getContext()` object. The function accepts a macro name that should be a unique string, and a string or a function that returns a string. The function will be called with a unique `nonce` string that will be different between each `substituteParams` call.\n\n```js\nconst { registerMacro } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Simple string macro\nregisterMacro('fizz', 'buzz');\n// Function macro\nregisterMacro('tomorrow', () => {\n    return new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toLocaleDateString();\n});\n```\n\nWhen a custom macro is no longer needed, remove it using the `unregisterMacro()` function:\n\n```js\nconst { unregisterMacro } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Unregister the 'fizz' macro\nunregisterMacro('fizz');\n```\n\n**Important details and known limitations regarding custom macros:**\n\n1. Currently only simple string replacement macros are supported. We're working on adding support for more complex macros in the future.\n2. Macros that use functions to provide a value *must* be synchronous. Returning a `Promise` will not work.\n3. You do not need to wrap the macro name in double curly braces (`{{ }}`) when registering it. SillyTavern will do that for you.\n4. Since macros are plain regular expression substitutions, registering a lot of macros will cause performance issues, so use them sparingly.\n\n## Do Extras request\n\nThe Extras API is deprecated. It's not recommended to use it in new extensions.\n\n**The `doExtrasFetch()` function allows you to make requests to your SillyTavern Extras API server.**\n\nFor example, to call the `/api/summarize` endpoint:\n\n```js\nimport { getApiUrl, doExtrasFetch } from \"../../extensions.js\";\n\nconst url = new URL(getApiUrl());\nurl.pathname = '/api/summarize';\n\nconst apiResult = await doExtrasFetch(url, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'Bypass-Tunnel-Reminder': 'bypass',\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n        // Request body\n    })\n});\n```\n\n`getApiUrl()` returns the base URL of the Extras server.\n\nThe `doExtrasFetch()` function:\n\n* Adds the `Authorization` and `Bypass-Tunnel-Reminder` headers\n* Handles fetching the result\n* Returns the result (the response object)\n\nThis makes it easy to call your Extras API from your extension.\n\nYou can specify:\n\n* The request method: GET, POST, etc.\n* Additional headers\n* The body for POST requests\n* Any other fetch options\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Security\n\n**Never store API keys or secrets in `extensionSettings`**\n\nExtension settings are accessible to all other extensions and are stored in plain text. Do not store sensitive data client-side:\n\n```js\n// BAD - Don't do this!\nextensionSettings[MODULE_NAME].apiKey = 'secret_key_123';\n\n// NOTE: There is no secure way to store secrets in client-side extensions.\n// If you need to handle sensitive data, use server plugins instead.\n// See: https://docs.sillytavern.app/for-contributors/server-plugins/\n```\n\n**Sanitize user inputs**\n\nAlways validate and sanitize data from user inputs before using it in commands, API calls, or DOM manipulation:\n\n```js\n// Validate input type first\nif (typeof userInput !== 'string') {\n    toastr.error('Invalid input type');\n    return;\n}\n// Use DOMPurify to sanitize HTML input\nconst { DOMPurify } = SillyTavern.libs;\nconst cleanInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);\n```\n\n**Avoid using `eval()` or `Function()` constructors**\n\nThese can execute arbitrary code and pose security risks. If you need dynamic evaluation, use safer alternatives or restrict the input carefully.\n\n### Performance\n\n**Don't store large data in `extensionSettings`**\n\nExtension settings are loaded into memory and saved frequently. Large data can cause performance issues:\n\n```js\n// BAD - Don't store large data\nextensionSettings[MODULE_NAME].largeDataset = { /* megabytes of data */ };\n\n// GOOD - Use localforage (abstraction over IndexedDB/localStorage)\nconst { localforage } = SillyTavern.libs;\nawait localforage.setItem(`${MODULE_NAME}_data`, largeData);\n\n// Or use localStorage for smaller data\nlocalStorage.setItem(`${MODULE_NAME}_data`, JSON.stringify(smallData));\n```\n\n**Clean up event listeners**\n\nRemove event listeners when they're no longer needed to prevent memory leaks:\n\n```js\nfunction cleanup() {\n    eventSource.removeListener(event_types.MESSAGE_RECEIVED, handleMessage);\n    document.getElementById('myElement').removeEventListener('click', handleClick);\n}\n```\n\n**Don't block the UI thread**\n\nFor heavy operations, use async/await or web workers:\n\n```js\n// Use async for I/O operations\nasync function processData() {\n    const result = await fetch('/api/process');\n    return result.json();\n}\n\n// Break up heavy computations\nasync function heavyComputation(data) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {\n        // Process chunk\n        if (i % 1000 === 0) {\n            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0)); // Yield to UI\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Compatibility\n\n**Prefer `getContext()` over direct imports**\n\nThe context API is more stable and less likely to break with SillyTavern updates:\n\n```js\n// GOOD - Stable API\nconst { chat, characters, saveSettingsDebounced } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// AVOID - May break with internal changes\nimport { chat, characters } from '../../../../script.js';\n```\n\n**Use unique module names**\n\nPrevent conflicts with other extensions by using a descriptive, unique module name:\n\n```js\n// GOOD - Specific and unique\nconst MODULE_NAME = 'my_extension_name';\n\n// BAD - Too generic, likely to conflict\nconst MODULE_NAME = 'settings';\n```\n\n### User Experience\n\n**Provide clear feedback**\n\nUse toastr notifications to inform users of actions and errors:\n\n```js\nconst { Popup } = SillyTavern.getContext();\n\n// Success message\ntoastr.success('Data imported successfully');\n\n// Error message\ntoastr.error('Failed to connect to API');\n\n// Warning message\ntoastr.warning('This feature is experimental');\n\n// For important messages, use popups\nconst result = await Popup.show.confirm('Confirm', 'Are you sure?');\nconst userInput = await Popup.show.input('Input', 'Please enter a value:', 'default value');\nawait Popup.show.text('Info', 'Operation completed successfully.');\n```\n\n**Provide helpful console messages**\n\nUse a consistent prefix for your console logs. But do not spam the console with excessive logs in production:\n\n```js\nconst MODULE_NAME = 'MyExtension';\n\nconsole.log(`[${MODULE_NAME}] Extension loaded`);\nconsole.debug(`[${MODULE_NAME}] Processing data:`, data);\nconsole.error(`[${MODULE_NAME}] Error occurred:`, error);\n```\n\n### Code Quality\n\n**Use bundled libraries from `lib.js`**\n\nSillyTavern bundles several useful libraries that extensions can be used directly:\n\n```js\n// Utility functions\nconst { lodash } = SillyTavern.libs;\nconst uniqueItems = lodash.uniq([1, 2, 2, 3]);\nconst grouped = lodash.groupBy([{ category: 'A', name: 'foo' }, { category: 'B', name: 'bar' }], 'category');\n\n// Fuzzy search\nconst { Fuse } = SillyTavern.libs;\nconst fuse = new Fuse(items, { keys: ['name', 'description'] });\nconst results = fuse.search('query');\n\n// Template rendering\nconst { Handlebars } = SillyTavern.libs;\nconst template = Handlebars.compile('<div>{{name}}</div>');\nconst html = template({ name: 'Example' });\n\n// Date/time manipulation\nconst { moment } = SillyTavern.libs;\nconst formatted = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss');\n```\n\nOther available libraries include: `DOMPurify`, `localforage`, `hljs`, `showdown`, `yaml`, and more. Check lib.js (https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/release/public/lib.js) for the full list.\n\n**Initialize settings properly**\n\nAlways provide defaults and handle missing keys:\n\n```js\nfunction loadSettings() {\n    // Merge with defaults to handle new keys after updates and initialize if it doesn't exist.\n    extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME] = SillyTavern.libs.lodash.merge(\n        structuredClone(defaultSettings),\n        extensionSettings[MODULE_NAME]\n    );\n}\n```"

    "url": "https://docs.sillytavern.app/for/contributors/function-calling",
    "content": "# Function Calling\n\nFunction Calling allows adding dynamic functionality to your extensions by letting the LLM use structured data that you then can use to trigger a specific functionality of the extension.\n\n## Example use cases\n\n1. Query external APIs for additional information (news, weather, web search, etc.).\n2. Perform calculations or conversions based on user input.\n3. Store and recall important memories or facts, including RAG and database queries.\n4. Introduce true randomness into the conversation (dice rolls, coin flips, etc.).\n\n## Officially supported extensions using function calling\n\n1. [Image Generation](SillyTavern_extensions_Stable-Diffusion.md) (built-in) - generate images based on user prompts.\n2. [Web Search](SillyTavern_extensions_WebSearch.md) - trigger a web search for a query.\n3. RSS (https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-RSS/) - fetch the latest news from RSS feeds.\n4. AccuWeather (https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-AccuWeather) - fetch the weather information from AccuWeather.\n5. D&D Dice (https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-Dice) - roll dice for D&D games.\n\n## Prerequisites and limitations\n\n1. This feature is only available for certain Chat Completion sources: OpenAI, Claude, MistralAI, Groq, Cohere, OpenRouter, AI21, Google AI Studio, Google Vertex AI, DeepSeek, AI/ML API and Custom API sources.\n2. Text Completion APIs don't support function calls, but some locally-hosted backends like Ollama and TabbyAPI may run in Custom OpenAI-compatible mode under Chat Completion.\n3. The support for function calling must be explicitly allowed by the user first. This is done by enabling the \"Enable function calling\" option in the AI Response Configuration panel.\n4. There is no guarantee that an LLM will perform any function calls at all. Most of them require an explicit \"activation\" through the prompt (e.g., the user asking to \"Roll a dice\", \"Get the weather\", etc.).\n5. Not all prompts can trigger a tool call. Continuations, impersonation, background ('quiet') prompts are not allowed to trigger a tool call. They can still use past successful tool calls in their responses.\n\n## How to make a function tool\n\n### Check if the feature is supported\n\nTo determine if the function tool calling feature is supported, you can call `isToolCallingSupported` from the `SillyTavern.getContext()` object. This will check if the current API supports function tool calling and if it's enabled in the settings. Here is an example of how to check if the feature is supported:\n\n```ts\nif (SillyTavern.getContext().isToolCallingSupported()) {\n    console.log(\"Function tool calling is supported\");\n} else {\n    console.log(\"Function tool calling is not supported\");\n}\n```\n\n### Register a function\n\nTo register a function tool, you need to call the `registerFunctionTool` function from the `SillyTavern.getContext()` object and pass the required parameters. Here is an example of how to register a function tool:\n\n```ts\nSillyTavern.getContext().registerFunctionTool({\n    // Internal name of the function tool. Must be unique.\n    name: \"myFunction\",\n    // Display name of the function tool. Will be shown in the UI. (Optional)\n    displayName: \"My Function\",\n    // Description of the function tool. Must describe what the function does and when to use it.\n    description: \"My function description. Use when you need to do something.\",\n    // JSON schema for the parameters of the function tool. See: https://json-schema.org/\n    parameters: {\n        $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#',\n        type: 'object',\n        properties: {\n            param1: {\n                type: 'string',\n                description: 'Parameter 1 description',\n            },\n            param2: {\n                type: 'string',\n                description: 'Parameter 2 description',\n            },\n        },\n        required: [\n            'param1', 'param2',\n        ],\n    },\n    // Function to call when the tool is triggered. Can be async.\n    // If the result is not a string, it will be JSON-stringified.\n    action: async ({ param1, param2 }) => {\n        // Your function code here\n        console.log(`Function called with parameters: ${param1}, ${param2}`);\n        return \"Function result\";\n    },\n    // Optional function to format the toast message displayed when the function is invoked.\n    // If an empty string is returned, no toast message will be displayed.\n    formatMessage: ({ param1, param2 }) => {\n        return `Function is called with: ${param1} and ${param2}`;\n    },\n    // Optional function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the tool should be registered for the current prompt.\n    // If no shouldRegister function is provided, the tool will be registered for every prompt.\n    shouldRegister: () => {\n        return true;\n    },\n    // Optional flag. If set to true, the function call will be performed, but the result won't be recorded to the visible chat history.\n    stealth: false,\n});\n```\n\n### Unregister a function\n\nTo deactivate a function tool, you need to call the `unregisterFunctionTool` function from the `SillyTavern.getContext()` object and pass the name of the function tool to disable. Here is an example of how to unregister a function tool:\n\n```ts\nSillyTavern.getContext().unregisterFunctionTool(\"myFunction\");\n```\n\n## Tips and tricks\n\n1. Successful tool calls are saved as a part of the visible history and will be displayed in the chat UI, so you can inspect the actual parameters and results. If that is not desirable, set the `stealth: true` flag when registering a function tool.\n2. If you don't want to see the tool call in the chat history. If you want to stylize or hide them with custom CSS, target a `toolCall` class on `.mes` elements, i.e. `.mes.toolCall { display: none; }` or `.mes.toolCall { color: #999; }`."

We work together to make SillyTavern accessible to everyone.\n\n**Everyone in the world should be able to use their own language on phones and computers.**\n\n--- \n\n## Let's fix some missing translations!\n\nAll 3 of these issues required code changes to fix. If you're adding a new translation, you might not need to touch\nthe code at all. Just add the translation to the JSON file. It just so happens that somebody recently added a large number\nof missing translations to the Chinese (Traditional) JSON file, so the remaining issues were all in the code. In other locales\nthere are plenty of missing translations you can fix without touching the code.\n\n**### `Generate Image`**\n\nThe text \"Generate Image\" is untranslated in the Chinese (Traditional) locale. Why?\n\nRight-click on the element and inspect it. You'll see the HTML:\n\n```html\n<!--rendered HTML-->\n<div class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5 interactable\" id=\"sd_gen\" tabindex=\"0\">\n    <div data-i18n=\"[title]Trigger Stable Diffusion\" title=\"\u89f8\u767c Stable Diffusion\"\n         class=\"fa-solid fa-paintbrush extensionsMenuExtensionButton\"></div>\n    <span>Generate Image</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nWhere is its `data-i18n` attribute? It's missing! Let's add it. We find it in the source code:\n\n```html\n<!--public/scripts/extensions/stable-diffusion/button.html-->\n<div id=\"sd_gen\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-paintbrush extensionsMenuExtensionButton\" title=\"Trigger Stable Diffusion\"\n         data-i18n=\"[title]Trigger Stable Diffusion\"></div>\n    <span>Generate Image</span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sd_stop_gen\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-circle-stop extensionsMenuExtensionButton\" title=\"Abort current image generation task\"\n         data-i18n=\"[title]Abort current image generation task\"></div>\n    <span>Stop Image Generation</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nWe are in luck, that string `Generate Image` is in many of the language files, including in Chinese (Traditional).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Generate Image\": \"\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\"\n}\n```\n\nWhy isn't it showing up? We have to wire the element up correctly:\n\n```html\n<!--public/scripts/extensions/stable-diffusion/button.html-->\n<div id=\"sd_gen\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-paintbrush extensionsMenuExtensionButton\" title=\"Trigger Stable Diffusion\"\n         data-i18n=\"[title]Trigger Stable Diffusion\"></div>\n    <span data-i18n=\"Generate Image\">Generate Image</span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sd_stop_gen\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-circle-stop extensionsMenuExtensionButton\" title=\"Abort current image generation task\"\n         data-i18n=\"[title]Abort current image generation task\"></div>\n    <span>Stop Image Generation</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nNow it works! Reload the page and see.\n\nBut while we have the HTML open, what's with `Stop Image Generation` just under it? The HTML doesn't look right.\n\nIf we generate an image and then open the wand menu while it's generating, we see untranslated text.\n\nFirst fix the HTML:\n\n```html\n<!--public/scripts/extensions/stable-diffusion/button.html-->\n<div id=\"sd_gen\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-paintbrush extensionsMenuExtensionButton\" title=\"Trigger Stable Diffusion\"\n         data-i18n=\"[title]Trigger Stable Diffusion\"></div>\n    <span data-i18n=\"Generate Image\">Generate Image</span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sd_stop_gen\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-circle-stop extensionsMenuExtensionButton\" title=\"Abort current image generation task\"\n         data-i18n=\"[title]Abort current image generation task\"></div>\n    <span data-i18n=\"Stop Image Generation\">Stop Image Generation</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis isn't enough to fix the issue. There are no translations for \"Stop Image Generation\" in the Chinese (Traditional)\nfile. We can add it! Here's one possible translation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Stop Image Generation\": \"\u505c\u6b62\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\"\n} \n```\n\n... which we can add to the JSON file just after the \"Generate Image\" translation.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Generate Image\": \"\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\",\n    \"Stop Image Generation\": \"\u505c\u6b62\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\"\n} \n```\n\nAfter some discussion with Claude, we're actually going to go with the following translations:\n\n- Traditional Chinese: \"Stop Image Generation\": \"\u7d42\u6b62\u5716\u7247\u751f\u6210\"\n- Simplified Chinese: \"Stop Image Generation\": \"\u4e2d\u6b62\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\"\n- Japanese: \"Stop Image Generation\": \"\u753b\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3092\u505c\u6b62\"\n\n### `Generate Caption`\n\n\"Generate Caption\" is untranslated in the Chinese (Traditional) locale. Let's fix it!\n\nWhere is it? Inspect the element.\n\n```html\n<!--rendered HTML-->\n<div id=\"send_picture\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5 interactable\" tabindex=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"fa-solid fa-image extensionsMenuExtensionButton\"></div>\n    Generate Caption\n</div>\n```\n\nTurns out that this HTML is produced by JavaScript. Let's find the source code.\n\n```js\n// public/scripts/extensions/caption/index.js\nconst sendButton = $(`\n        <div id=\"send_picture\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n            <div class=\"fa-solid fa-image extensionsMenuExtensionButton\"></div>\n            Generate Caption\n        </div>`);\n```\n\nWe will first have to fix the code:\n\n```js\n// public/scripts/extensions/caption/index.js\nconst sendButton = $(`\n        <div id=\"send_picture\" class=\"list-group-item flex-container flexGap5\">\n            <div class=\"fa-solid fa-image extensionsMenuExtensionButton\"></div>\n            <span data-i18n=\"Generate Caption\">Generate Caption</span>\n        </div>`);\n``` \n\nThere are also no translations for \"Generate Caption\" in the Chinese (Traditional) file. Let's add it!\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Generate Caption\": \"\u751f\u6210\u5716\u7247\u8aaa\u660e\"\n}\n```\n\nWe will use the following translations:\n\n- Traditional Chinese: \"Generate Caption\": \"\u751f\u6210\u5716\u7247\u8aaa\u660e\"\n- Simplified Chinese: \"Generate Caption\": \"\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\u8bf4\u660e\"\n- Japanese: \"Generate Caption\": \"\u753b\u50cf\u8aac\u660e\u3092\u751f\u6210\"\n\n### `Inspect Prompts`\n\nThe text \"Inspect Prompts\" is untranslated in the Chinese (Traditional) locale. Why?\nThis one is a bit more complicated. The text is generated by JavaScript, and the translation is missing.\n\n```js\n// Extension-PromptInspector/index.js\nconst enabledText = 'Stop Inspecting';\nconst disabledText = 'Inspect Prompts';\n```\n\nWell wouldn't you know it... neither phrase is in the i18n files. Let's add them.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Stop Inspecting\": \"\u505c\u6b62\u6aa2\u67e5\",\n    \"Inspect Prompts\": \"\u6aa2\u67e5\u63d0\u793a\"\n}\n```\n\nNow we have to fix the JavaScript code. It has to use the `t` function to get the translation.\n\n```js\n// Extension-PromptInspector/index.js\nimport {t} from '../../../i18n.js';\n\nconst enabledText = t`Stop Inspecting`;\nconst disabledText = t`Inspect Prompts`;\n```\n\nWe got these suggestions from Claude. Keep the strings, ignore the code. They have to be added to the JSON files.\n\n```js\n// 1. Simplified Chinese (zh-cn):\nconst enabledText = t`\u505c\u6b62\u68c0\u67e5`;\nconst disabledText = t`\u68c0\u67e5\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd`;\n// 2. Traditional Chinese (zh-tw):\nconst enabledText = t`\u505c\u6b62\u6aa2\u67e5`;\nconst disabledText = t`\u6aa2\u67e5\u63d0\u793a\u8a5e`;\n// 3. Japanese (ja-jp):\nconst enabledText = t`\u691c\u67fb\u3092\u505c\u6b62`;\nconst disabledText = t`\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u691c\u67fb`;\n```\n\nWe will merge those into the JSON files.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Stop Inspecting\": \"\u505c\u6b62\u68c0\u67e5\",\n    \"Inspect Prompts\": \"\u68c0\u67e5\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Stop Inspecting\": \"\u505c\u6b62\u6aa2\u67e5\",\n    \"Inspect Prompts\": \"\u6aa2\u67e5\u63d0\u793a\u8a5e\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Stop Inspecting\": \"\u691c\u67fb\u3092\u505c\u6b62\",\n    \"Inspect Prompts\": \"\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u691c\u67fb\"\n}\n```\n\nA pity about that tooltip. The problem is that the code doesn't use\nthe `t` function.\n\n```js\nlaunchButton.title = 'Toggle prompt inspection';\n```\n\nWe will have to fix that in the extension code.\n\n```js\nlaunchButton.title = t`Toggle prompt inspection`;\n```\n\nWe also need to add the translations to the JSON files.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Toggle prompt inspection\": \"\u5207\u6362\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u67e5\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Toggle prompt inspection\": \"\u5207\u6362\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u68c0\u67e5\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Toggle prompt inspection\": \"\u30d7\u30ed\u30f3\u30d7\u30c8\u691c\u67fb\u306e\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u3048\"\n}\n```\n\nPrompt inspector is a separate extension, so we will PR the code fixes to that\nrepo: https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-PromptInspector/pull/1\n\nThe translations will be added to the main SillyTavern repo. https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/pull/3198\n\n## Language files\n\nEach language has a JSON file in `public/locales/` named with its language code (e.g., `ru-ru.json`).\n\nThe file contains key-value pairs where:\n\n- Keys are either the original English text or unique identifiers\n- Values are the translated text\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Save\": \"\u0421\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c\",\n    \"Cancel\": \"\u041e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\",\n    \"Could not find proxy with name '${0}'\": \"\u041d\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c '${0}'\"\n}\n```\n\n## How translations work\n\nThere are two ways translations are used in the application:\n\n1. **HTML Elements**: Using `data-i18n` attributes\n   ```html\n   <div data-i18n=\"some_key\">Default Text</div>\n   ```\n   The default text in the HTML will be replaced with the translated text if available.\n\n2. **Template Strings**: In the JavaScript code using the `t` function\n   ```javascript\n   t`Some text with ${variable}`\n   ```\n   These strings should be translated keeping the `${0}`, `${1}`, etc. placeholders intact.\n\nSillyTavern uses HTML elements with `data-i18n` attributes to mark translatable content. There are several ways to use\nthis:\n\n### 1. Translating Element Text\n\nFor simple text content:\n\n```html\n<span data-i18n=\"Role:\">Role:</span>\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role:\": \"\u0420\u043e\u043b\u044c:\"\n}\n```\n\nThis replaces the element's text content with the translation of \"Role:\".\n\n### 2. Translating Attributes\n\nTo translate an attribute like a title or placeholder:\n\n```html\n<a class=\"menu_button fa-chain fa-solid fa-fw\"\n   title=\"Insert prompt\"\n   data-i18n=\"[title]Insert prompt\"></a>\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Insert prompt\": \"\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0442\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `[title]` prefix indicates which attribute to translate. The rest of the attribute value is the text that will\nbe used as a lookup key in the JSON file. It is common for coders to use the English text as the key, but it is not\nrequired. The key can be any unique identifier.\n\nThe original English text must be present in the corresponding attribute (`title=\"Insert prompt\"`) though. It's used as\na fallback if the translation is missing. Most notably, there is no translation file for English.\n\nHere is an example of using a unique identifier `no_items_text` as the key, rather than the English text:\n\n```html\n<!--suppress HtmlUnknownAttribute -->\n<div class=\"openai_logit_bias_list\" no_items_text=\"No items\"\n     data-i18n=\"[no_items_text]openai_logit_bias_no_items\"></div>\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"openai_logit_bias_no_items\": \"\u6ca1\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u4ea7\u54c1\"\n}   \n```\n\n### 3. Multiple Translations Per Element\n\nSome elements need both content and attribute translations, separated by semicolons. The most common pattern is\ntranslating both the element's text content and its title attribute:\n\n```html\n<div data-source=\"openrouter\" class=\"menu_button menu_button_icon openrouter_authorize\"\n     title=\"Get your OpenRouter API token using OAuth flow. You will be redirected to openrouter.ai\"\n     data-i18n=\"Authorize;[title]Get your OpenRouter API token using OAuth flow. You will be redirected to openrouter.ai\">\n    Authorize\n</div>\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Authorize\": \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f\",\n    \"Get your OpenRouter API token using OAuth flow. You will be redirected to openrouter.ai\": \"\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 OpenRouter API \u0442\u043e\u043a\u0435\u043d \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044f OAuth. \u0423 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430 openrouter.ai\"\n}\n```\n\nThis translates:\n\n- The element's text content using the key \"Authorize\"\n- The title attribute using the key \"Get your OpenRouter API token using OAuth flow. You will be redirected to\n  openrouter.ai\"\n\nNote that both the `title` attribute and the element's text content are provided in English as fallbacks.\n\nYou can also translate multiple attributes:\n\n```html\n<!--suppress HtmlUnknownAttribute -->\n<textarea id=\"send_textarea\" name=\"text\" class=\"mdHotkeys\"\n          data-i18n=\"[no_connection_text]Not connected to API!;[connected_text]Type a message, or /? for help\"\n          placeholder=\"Not connected to API!\"\n          no_connection_text=\"Not connected to API!\"\n          connected_text=\"Type a message, or /? for help\"></textarea>\n```\n\nThe corresponding translations in your language file would look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Not connected to API!\": \"\u041d\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441 API!\",\n    \"Type a message, or /? for help\": \"\u0412\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u043b\u0438 /? \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438\"\n}\n```\n\nWhen the page loads, the system:\n\n1. Finds all elements with `data-i18n` attributes\n2. Parses any attribute prefixes like `[title]` or `[placeholder]`\n3. Looks up each key in your language's JSON file\n4. Replaces the element's content or attributes with the translated text\n\n### Dynamic Text\n\nFor dynamic text in JavaScript code, translations use either:\n\n1. Template literals with the `t` function:\n    ```javascript\n    toastr.warn(t`Tag ${tagName} not found.`);\n    ```\n2. Direct translation function:\n    ```javascript\n    translate(\"Some text\", \"optional_key\")\n    ```\n\n### Variable Placeholders\n\nSome strings contain placeholders for dynamic values using `${0}`, `${1}`, etc:\n\n```js\ntoastr.error(t`Could not find proxy with name '${presetName}'`);\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Could not find proxy with name '${0}'\": \"\u041d\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0438 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c '${0}'\"\n}\n```\n\nKeep the placeholders the same for key and translation. The system will replace `${0}` with the value of `presetName`, etc.\n\n## Finding missing translations\n\nLet's say you don't just want to fix one annoying missing translation, you want to find them all.\n\nThat's a big ambition! Even fixing one translation is worth it. But if you want to catch 'em all, you need a tool.\n\n### SillyTavern-i18n\n\nhttps://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-i18n\n\nTools for working with frontend localization files.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Automatically add new keys to translate from HTML files.\n- Prune missing keys from localization files.\n- Use automatic Google translation to auto-populate missing values.\n- Sort JSON files by keys.\n\n### Inbuilt debug functions\n\nThese are under <i class=\"fa-fw fa-solid fa-user-cog\"></i> **User Settings** > **Debug Menu**.\n\n#### Get missing translations\n\nDetects missing localization data in the current locale and dumps the data into the browser console. If the current\nlocale is English, searches all other locales.\n\nThe console will show a table of missing translations with:\n\n- key: The text or identifier needing translation\n- language: Your current language code\n- value: The English text to translate\n\n#### Apply locale\n\nReapplies the currently selected locale to the page\n\n**Neither of these tools are perfect**\n\n- they don't catch missing translations in JavaScript code\n- they don't catch missing data-i18n attributes in HTML, they just catch untranslated keys\n- there are bugs in the code for `getMissingTranslations`: keys should not be prefixed with `[title]` or `[placeholder]`\n\n**## Adding a new language**\n\nTo add support for a new language:\n\n1. Add your language to `public/locales/lang.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"lang\": \"xx-xx\",\n     \"display\": \"Language Name (English Name)\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Create `public/locales/xx-xx.json` with your translations\n\n## Contributing\n\nWhen your translations are ready:\n\n1. Verify your JSON file is valid\n2. Test thoroughly in the application\n3.

This means they can potentially gain access to your entire file system, or introduce a wide range of security vulnerabilities in a way that normal UI extensions cannot.

This function accepts an Express router (created specifically for your plugin) as an argument and returns a Promise.\n\nThe module should also export an `info` object containing information about the plugin (`id`, `name`, and `description` strings). This will provide information about the plugin to the loader.\n\nYou can register routes via the router that will be registered under the `/api/plugins/{id}/{route}` path. For example, `router.get('/foo')` for the `example` plugin will produce a route like this: `/api/plugins/example/foo`.\n\nA plugin can also *optionally* export an `exit` function that performs clean-up when shutting down the server. It should have no arguments and must return a Promise.\n\nTypeScript contract for plugin exports:\n\n```ts\ninterface PluginInfo {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    description: string;\n}\n\ninterface Plugin {\n    init: (router: Router) => Promise<void>;\n    exit: () => Promise<void>;\n    info: PluginInfo;\n}\n```\n\nSee below for a \"Hello world!\" plugin example:\n\n```js\n/**\n * Initialize plugin.\n * @param {import('express').Router} router Express router\n * @returns {Promise<any>} Promise that resolves when plugin is initialized\n */\nasync function init(router) {\n    // Do initialization here...\n    router.get('/foo', req, res, function () {\n       res.send('bar');\n    });\n    console.log('Example plugin loaded!');\n    return Promise.resolve();\n}\n\nasync function exit() {\n    // Do some clean-up here...\n    return Promise.resolve();\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    init,\n    exit,\n    info: {\n        id: 'example',\n        name: 'Example',\n        description: 'My cool plugin!',\n    },\n};\n```\n\n### Directories\n\nYou can load a plugin from a subdirectory in the `plugins` directory in one of the following ways (in order of precedence):\n\n1. A `package.json` file that contains a path to an executable file in the \"main\" field.\n2. An `index.js` file for CommonJS modules.\n3. An `index.mjs` file for ES modules.\n\nA resulting file must export an `init` function and an `info` object with the same requirements as for individual files.\n\nExample of a directory plugin (with an `index.js` file): <https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-DiscordRichPresence-Server>\n\n### Bundling\n\nIt is preferable to use a bundler (such as Webpack or Browserify) that will package all the requirements into one file. Make sure to set \"Node\" as a build target.\n\nTemplate repository for plugins using Webpack and TypeScript: <https://github.com/SillyTavern/Plugin-WebpackTemplate>"

    "content": "# STscript Language Reference\n\n## What is STscript?\n\nIt's a simple yet powerful scripting language that could be used to expand the functionality of SillyTavern without serious coding, allowing you to:\n\n- Create mini-games or speed run challenges\n- Build AI-powered chat insights\n- Unleash your creativity and share with others\n\nSTscript is built using the slash commands engine, utilizing command batching, data piping, macros, and variables.\nThese concepts are going to be described in the following document.\n\n### Security precaution\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility. Be careful and always inspect the scripts before executing them.\n\n## Hello, World!\n\nTo run your first script, open any SillyTavern chat and type the following into the chat input bar:\n\n```stscript\n/pass Hello, World! | /echo\n```\n\n|-------------------------------------------------|\n\nYou should see the message in the toast on top of the screen. Now let's break it down bit by bit.\n\nA script is a batch of commands, each one starting with the slash, with or without named and unnamed arguments, and terminated with the command separator character: `|`.\n\nCommands are executed sequentially, one after another, and transfer data between each other.\n\n1. The `/pass` command accepts a constant value of \"Hello, World!\" as an unnamed argument and writes it to the pipe.\n2. The `/echo` command receives the value through the pipe from the previous command and displays it as a toast notification.\n\n**Hint:** To see a list of all available commands, type `/help slash` into the chat.\n\n**As constant unnamed arguments and pipes are interchangeable, we could rewrite this script simply as:**\n\n```stscript\n/echo Hello, World!\n```\n\n## User input\n\nNow let's add a little bit of interactivity to the script. We will accept the input value from the user and display it in the notification.\n\n```stscript\n/input Enter your name |\n/echo Hello, my name is {{pipe}}\n```\n\n1. The `/input` command is used to display an input box with the prompt specified in the unnamed argument and then writes the output to the pipe.\n2. Because `/echo` already has an unnamed argument that sets the template for the output, we use the `{{pipe}}` macro to specify a place where the pipe value will be rendered.\n\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n\n### Other input/output commands\n\n- `/popup (text)` \u2014 shows a blocking popup, supports lite HTML formatting, e.g: `/popup <font color=red>I'm red!</font>`.\n- `/setinput (text)` \u2014 replaces the contents of the user input bar with the provided text.\n- `/speak voice=\"name\" (text)` \u2014 narrates the text using the selected TTS engine and the character name from the voice map, e.g. `/speak name=\"Donald Duck\" Quack!`.\n- `/buttons labels=[\"a\",\"b\"] (text)` \u2014 shows a blocking popup with the specified text and button labels. `labels` must be a JSON-serialized array of strings or a variable name containing such an array. Returns the clicked button label into the pipe or empty string if canceled. The text supports lite HTML formatting.\n\n#### Arguments for `/popup` and `/input`\n\n`/popup` and `/input` support the following additional named arguments:\n- `large=on/off` - increases the vertical size of the popup. Default: `off`.\n- `wide=on/off` - increases the horizontal size of the popup. Default: `off`.\n- `okButton=string` - adds ability to customize the text on the \"Ok\" button. Default: `Ok`.\n- `rows=number` - (only for `/input`) increases the size of the input control. Default: 1.\n\nExample:\n```stscript\n/popup large=on wide=on okButton=\"Accept\" Please accept our terms and conditions....\n```\n\n#### Arguments for `/echo`\n\n`/echo` supports the following values for the additional `severity` argument that sets the style of the displayed message.\n  - `warning`\n  - `error`\n  - `info` (default)\n  - `success`\n\nExample:\n\n```stscript\n/echo severity=error Something really bad happened.\n```\n\n## Variables\n\nVariables are used to store and manipulate data in scripts, using either commands or macros. The variables could be one of the following types:\n\n- Local variables \u2014 saved to the metadata of the current chat, and unique to it.\n- Global variables \u2014 saved to the settings.json and exist everywhere across the app.\n\n1. `/getvar name` or `{{getvar::name}}` \u2014 gets the value of the local variable.\n2. `/setvar key=name value` or `{{setvar::name::value}}` \u2014 sets the value of the local variable.\n3. `/addvar key=name increment` or `{{addvar::name::increment}}` \u2014 adds the `increment` to the value of the local variable.\n4. `/incvar name` or `{{incvar::name}}` \u2014 increments a value of the local variable by 1.\n5. `/decvar name` or `{{decvar::name}}` \u2014 decrements a value of the local variable by 1.\n6. `/getglobalvar name` or `{{getglobalvar::name}}` \u2014 gets the value of the global variable.\n7. `/setglobalvar key=name` or `{{setglobalvar::name::value}}` \u2014 sets the value of the global variable.\n8. `/addglobalvar key=name` or `{{addglobalvar::name:increment}}` \u2014 adds the `increment` to the value of the global variable.\n9. `/incglobalvar name` or `{{incglobalvar::name}}` \u2014 increments a value of the global variable by 1.\n10. `/decglobalvar name` or `{{decglobalvar::name}}` \u2014 decrements a value of the global variable by 1.\n11. `/flushvar name` \u2014 deletes the value of the local variable.\n12. `/flushglobalvar name` \u2014 deletes the value of the global variable.\n\n- The default value of previously undefined variables is an empty string or a zero of it is first used in the `/addvar`, `/incvar`, `/decvar` command.\n- Increment in the `/addvar` command performs an addition or subtraction of the value if both increment and the variable value can be converted to a number, or otherwise does the string concatenation.\n- If a command argument accepts a variable name and both local and global variables exist with the same name, then the *local variable* takes priority.\n- All *slash commands* for variable manipulation write the resulting value into the pipe for the next command to use.\n- For *macros*, only the \"get\", \"inc\", and \"dec\" type macro returns the value, \"add\" and \"set\" are replaced with an empty string instead.\n\nNow, let's consider the following example:\n\n```stscript\n/input What do you want to generate? |\n/setvar key=SDinput |\n/echo Requesting an image of {{getvar::SDinput}} |\n/getvar SDinput |\n/imagine\n```\n\n1. The value of the user input is saved in the local variable named `SDinput`.\n2. The `getvar` macro is used to display the value in the `/echo` command.\n3. The `getvar` command is used to retrieve the value of the variable and pass it through the pipe.\n4. The value is passed to the `/imagine` command (provided by the Image Generation plugin) to be used as its input prompt.\n\nSince the variables are saved and not flushed between the script executions, you can reference the variable in other scripts and via macros, and it will resolve to the same value as during the execution of the example script. To guarantee that the value will be discarded, add the `/flushvar` command to the script.\n\n### Arrays and objects\n\nVariable values can contain JSON-serialized arrays or key-value pairs (objects).\n\nExamples:\n- Array: `[\"apple\",\"banana\",\"orange\"]`\n- Object: `{\"fruits\":[\"apple\",\"banana\",\"orange\"]}`\n\nThe following modifications can be applied to commands to work with these variables:\n\n- `/len` commands gets a number of items in the array.\n- `index=number/string` named argument can be added `/getvar` or `/setvar` and their global counterparts to get or set sub-values by either a zero-based index for arrays or a string key for objects.\n  - If a numeric index is used on a nonexistent variable, the variable will be created as an empty array `[]`.\n  - If a string index is used on a nonexistent variable, the variable will be created as an empty object `{}`.\n- `/addvar` and `/addglobalvar` commands support pushing a new value to array-typed variables.\n\n## Flow control - conditionals\n\nYou can use the `/if` command to create conditional expressions that branch the execution based on the defined rules.\n\n```stscript\n/if left=valueA right=valueB rule=comparison else={: /echo (command on false) :} {: /echo (command on true) :}\n```\n\nNote that\n\n```stscript\n/if left=valueA right=valueB rule=comparison else=\"(command on false)\" \"(command on true)\"\n```\n\nsyntax is also supported, however `{: closures :}` will help you write cleaner scripts.\n\nLet's review the following example:\n\n```stscript\n/input What's your favorite drink? |\n/if left={{pipe}} right=\"black tea\" rule=eq else={: /echo You shall not pass | /abort :} {: /echo Welcome to the club, {{user}} :}\n```\n\nThis script evaluates the user input against a required value and displays different messages, depending on the input value.\n\n### Arguments for `/if`\n\n1. `left` is the first operand. Let's call it A.\n2. `right` is the second operand. Let's call it B.\n3. `rule` is the operation to be applied to the operands.\n4. `else` is the optional string of subcommands to be executed if the result of boolean comparison is false.\n5. Unnamed argument is the subcommand to be executed if the result of boolean comparison is true.\n\nThe operand values are evaluated in the following order:\n\n1. Numeric literals\n2. Local variable names\n3. Global variable names\n4. String literals\n\nString values of named arguments could be escaped with quotes to allow multi-word strings. Quotes are then discarded.\n\n### Boolean operations\n\nSupported rules for boolean comparison are the following. An operation applied to the operands results in either a true or false value.\n\n1. `eq` (equals) => A = B\n2. `neq` (not equals) => A != B\n3. `lt` (less than) => A < B\n4. `gt` (greater than) => A > B\n5. `lte` (less than or equals) => A <= B\n6. `gte` (greater than or equals) => A >= B\n7. `not` (unary negation) => !A\n8. `in` (includes substring) => A includes B, case insensitive\n9. `nin` (not includes substring) => A not includes B, case insensitive\n\n### Subcommands\n\nA subcommand is a string containing a list of slash commands to execute.\n\n1. To use command batching in subcommands, the command separator character should be escaped (see below).\n2. Since macro values are executed when the conditional is entered, not when the subcommand is executed, a macro could be additionally escaped to delay their evaluation to the subcommand execution time.\n3. The result of the subcommands execution is piped to the command after `/if`.\n4. The `/abort` command interrupts the script execution when encountered.\n\n`/if` commands can be used as a ternary operator.\nThe following example will pass a \"true\" string to the next command the variable `a` equals 5, and a \"false\" string otherwise.\n\n```stscript\n/if left=a right=5 rule=eq else={: /pass false:} {: /pass true :} |\n/echo\n```\n\n## Escape Sequences\n\n### Macros\n\nEscaping of macros works just like before. However, with closures, you will need to escape macros a lot less often than before. Either escape the two opening curly braces, or both the opening and closing pair.\n\n```stscript\n/echo \\{\\{char}} |\n/echo \\{\\{char\\}\\}\n```\n\n### Pipes\n\nPipes don't need to be escaped in closures (when used as command separators). Everywhere where you want to use a literal pipe character instead of a command separator, you need to escape it.\n\n```stscript\n/echo title=\"a\\|b\" c\\|d |\n/echo title=a\\|b c\\|d |\n```\n\nWith the parser flag `STRICT_ESCAPING` you don't need to escape pipes in quoted values.\n\n```stscript\n/parser-flag STRICT_ESCAPING |\n/echo title=\"a|b\" c\\|d |\n/echo title=a\\|b c\\|d |\n```\n\n### Quotes\n\nTo use a literal quote-character inside a quoted value, the character must be escaped.\n\n```stscript\n/echo title=\"a \\\"b\\\" c\" d \"e\" f\n```\n\n### Spaces\n\nTo use space in the value of a named argument, you either have to surround the value in quote, or escape the space character.\n\n```stscript\n/echo title=\"a b\" c d |\n/echo title=a\\ b c d\n```\n\n### Closure Delimiters\n\nIf you want to use the character combinations used to mark the beginning or end of a closure, you have to escape the sequence with a single backslash.\n\n```stscript\n/echo \\{: |\n/echo \\:}\n```\n\n## Pipe Breakers\n\n```stscript\n||\n```\n\nTo prevent the previous command's output from being automatically injected as the unnamed argument into the next command, put double pipes between the two commands.\n\n```stscript\n/echo we don't want to pass this on ||\n/world\n```\n\n## Closures\n\n```stscript\n{: ... :}\n```\n\nClosures (block statements, lambdas, anonymous functions, whatever you want to call them) are a series of commands wrapped between `{:` and `:}`, that are only evaluated once that part of the code is executed.\n\n### Sub-Commands\n\nClosures make using sub-commands a lot easier and get rid of the need to escape pipes and macros.\n\n```stscript\n// if without closures |\n/if left=1 rule=eq right=1\n    else=\"\n        /echo not equal \\|\n        /return 0\n    \"\n    /echo equal \\|\n    /return \\{\\{pipe}}\n```\n\n```stscript\n// if with closures |\n/if left=1 rule=eq right=1\n    else={:\n        /echo not equal |\n        /return 0\n    :}\n    {:\n        /echo equal |\n        /return {{pipe}}\n    :}\n```\n\n### Scopes\n\nClosures have their own scope and support scoped variables. Scoped variables are declared with `/let`, their values set and retrieved with `/var`. Another way to get a scoped variable is the `{{var::}}` macro.\n\n```stscript\n/let x |\n/let y 2 |\n/var x 1 |\n/var y |\n/echo x is {{var::x}} and y is {{pipe}}.\n```\n\nWithin a closure, you have access to all variables declared within that same closure or in one of its ancestors. You don't have access to variables declared in a closure's descendants.  \nIf a variable is declared with the same name as a variable that was declared in one of the closure's ancestors, you don't have access to the ancestor variable in this closure and its descendants.\n\n```stscript\n/let x this is root x |\n/let y this is root y |\n/return {:\n    /echo called from level-1: x is \"{{var::x}}\" and y is \"{{var::y}}\" |\n    /delay 500 |\n    /let x this is level-1 x |\n    /echo called from level-1: x is \"{{var::x}}\" and y is \"{{var::y}}\" |\n    /delay 500 |\n    /return {:\n        /echo called from level-2: x is \"{{var::x}}\" and y is \"{{var::y}}\" |\n        /let x this is level-2 x |\n        /echo called from level-2: x is \"{{var::x}}\" and y is \"{{var::y}}\" |\n        /delay 500\n    :}()\n:}() |\n/echo called from root: x is \"{{var::x}}\" and y is \"{{var::y}}\"\n```\n\n### Named Closures\n\n```stscript\n/let x {: ... :} | /:x\n```\n\nClosures can be assigned to variables (only scoped variables) to be called at a later point or to be used as sub-commands.\n\n```stscript\n/let myClosure {:\n    /echo this is my closure\n:} |\n/:myClosure\n```\n\n```stscript\n/let myClosure {:\n    /echo this is my closure |\n    /delay 500\n:} |\n/times 3 {{var::myClosure}}\n```\n\n`/:` can also be used to execute Quick Replies, as it is just a shorthand for `/run`.\n\n```stscript\n/:QrSetName.QrButtonLabel |\n/run QrSetName.QrButtonLabel\n```\n\n### Closure Arguments\n\nNamed closures can take named arguments, just like slash commands. The arguments can have default values.\n\n```stscript\n/let myClosure {: a=1 b=\n    /echo a is {{var::a}} and b is {{var::b}}\n:} |\n/:myClosure b=10\n```\n\n### Closures and Piped Arguments\n\nThe piped value from a parent closure will not be automatically injected into the first command of a child closure.  \nYou can still explicitly reference the parent's piped value with `{{pipe}}`, but if you leave the unnamed argument of the first command inside a closure blank, the value will *not* be automatically injected.\n\n```stscript\n/* This used to attempt to change the model to \"foo\"\n   because the value \"foo\" from the /echo outside of\n   the loop was injected into the /model command\n   inside of the loop.\n   Now it will simply echo the current model without \n   attempting to change it.\n*|\n/echo foo |\n/times 2 {:\n\t/model |\n\t/echo |\n:} |\n```\n```stscript\n/* You can still recreate the old behavior by\n   explicitly using the {{pipe}} macro.\n*|\n/echo foo |\n/times 2 {:\n\t/model {{pipe}} |\n\t/echo |\n:} |\n```\n\n### Immediately Executed Closures\n\n```stscript\n{: ... :}()\n```\n\nClosures can be immediately executed, meaning they will be replaced with their return value. This is helpful in places where no explicit support for closures exists, and to shorten some commands that would otherwise require a lot of intermediate variables.\n\n```stscript\n// a simple length comparison of two strings without closures |\n/len foo |\n/var lenOfFoo {{pipe}} |\n/len bar |\n/var lenOfBar {{pipe}} |\n/if left={{var::lenOfFoo}} rule=eq right={{var:lenOfBar}} /echo yay!\n```\n\n```stscript\n// the same comparison with immediately executed closures |\n/if left={:/len foo:}() rule=eq right={:/len bar:}() /echo yay!\n```\n\nIn addition to running named closures saved inside scoped variables, the `/run` command can also be used to execute closures immediately.\n\n```stscript\n/run {:\n\t/add 1 2 3 4 |\n:} |\n/echo |\n```\n\n## Comments\n\n```stscript\n// ... | /# ...\n```\n\nA comment is a human-readable explanation or annotation in the script code. Comments don't break pipes.\n\n```stscript\n// this is a comment |\n/echo foo |\n/# this is also a comment\n```\n\n### Block Comments\n\nBlock comments can be used to quickly comment out multiple commands at once. They will not terminate on a pipe.\n\n```stscript\n/echo foo |\n/*\n/echo bar |\n/echo foobar |\n*|\n/echo foo again |\n```\n\n## Flow Control\n\n### Loops: `/while` and `/times`\n\nIf you need to run some command in a loop until a certain condition is met, use the `/while` command.\n\n```stscript\n/while left=valueA right=valueB rule=operation guard=on \"commands\"\n```\n\nOn each step of the loop it compares the value of variable A with the value of variable B, and if the condition yields true, then executes any valid slash command enclosed in quotes, otherwise exists the loop. This command doesn't write anything to the output pipe.\n\n#### Arguments for `/while`\n\n**The set of available boolean comparisons, handing of variables, literal values, and subcommands is the same as for the `/if` command.**\n\nThe optional `guard` named argument (`on` by default) is used to protect against endless loops, limiting the number of iterations to 100.\nTo disable and allow endless loops, set `guard=off`.\n\nThis example adds 1 to the value of `i` until it reaches 10, then outputs the resulting value (10 in this case).\n\n```stscript\n/setvar key=i 0 |\n/while left=i right=10 rule=lt \"/addvar key=i 1\" |\n/echo {{getvar::i}} |\n/flushvar i\n```\n\n#### Arguments for `/times`\n\nRuns a subcommand a specified number of times.\n\n`/times (repeats) \"(command)\"` \u2013 any valid slash command enclosed in quotes repeats a number of times, e.g. `/setvar key=i 1 | /times 5 \"/addvar key=i 1\"` adds 1 to the value of \"i\" 5 times.\n- {{timesIndex}} is replaced with the iteration number (zero-based), e.g. `/times 4 {:/echo {{timesIndex}}:}` echoes the numbers 0 through 4.\n- Loops are limited to 100 iterations by default, pass `guard=off` to disable.\n\n### Breaking out of Loops and Closures\n\n```stscript\n/break |\n```\n\nThe `/break` command can be used to break out of a loop (`/while` or `/times`) or a closure early. The unnamed argument of `/break` can be used to pass a value different from the current pipe along.  \n`/break` is currently implemented in the following commands:\n- `/while` - exits the loop early\n- `/times` - exits the loop early\n- `/run` (with a closure or closure via variable) - exits the closure early\n- `/:` (with a closure) - exits the closure early\n\n```stscript\n/times 10 {:\n\t/echo {{timesIndex}}\n\t/delay 500 |\n\t/if left={{timesIndex}} rule=gt right=3 {:\n\t\t/break\n\t:} |\n:} |\n```\n\n```stscript\n/let x {: iterations=2\n\t/if left={{var::iterations}} rule=gt right=10 {:\n\t\t/break too many iterations! |\n\t:} |\n\t/times {{var::iterations}} {:\n\t\t/delay 500 |\n\t\t/echo {{timesIndex}} |\n\t:} |\n:} |\n/:x iterations=30 |\n/echo the final result is: {{pipe}}\n```\n\n```stscript\n/run {:\n\t/break 1 |\n\t/pass 2 |\n:} |\n/echo pipe will be one: {{pipe}} |\n```\n\n```stscript\n/let x {:\n\t/break 1 |\n\t/pass 2 |\n:} |\n/:x |\n/echo pipe will be one: {{pipe}} |\n```\n\n## Math operations\n\n- All of the following operations accept a series of numbers or variable names and output the result to the pipe.\n- Invalid operations (such as division by zero), and operations that result in a NaN value or infinity return zero.\n- Multiplication, addition, minimum and maximum accept an unlimited number of arguments separated by spaces.\n- Subtraction, division, exponentiation, and modulo accept two arguments separated by spaces.\n- Sine, cosine, natural logarithm, square root, absolute value, and rounding accept one argument.\n\n**List of operations:**\n\n1. `/add (a b c d)` \u2013 performs an addition of the set of values, e.g. `/add 10 i 30 j`\n2. `/mul (a b c d)` \u2013 performs a multiplication of the set of values, e.g. `/mul 10 i 30 j`\n3. `/max (a b c d)` \u2013 returns a maximum from the set of values, e.g. `/max 1 0 4 k`\n4. `/min (a b c d)` \u2013 return a minimum from the set of values, e.g. `/min 5 4 i 2`\n5. `/sub (a b)` \u2013 performs a subtraction of two values, e.g. `/sub i 5`\n6. `/div (a b)` \u2013 performs a division of two values, e.g. `/div 10 i`\n7. `/mod (a b)` \u2013 performs a modulo operation of two values, e.g. `/mod i 2`\n8. `/pow (a b)` \u2013 performs a power operation of two values, e.g. `/pow i 2`\n9. `/sin (a)` \u2013 performs a sine operation of a value, e.g. `/sin i`\n10. `/cos (a)` \u2013 performs a cosine operation of a value, e.g. `/cos i`\n11. `/log (a)` \u2013 performs a natural logarithm operation of a value, e.g. `/log i`\n12. `/abs (a)` \u2013 performs an absolute value operation of a value, e.g. `/abs -10`\n13. `/sqrt (a)`\u2013 performs a square root operation of a value, e.g. `/sqrt 9`\n14. `/round (a)` \u2013 performs a rounding to the nearest integer operation of a value, e.g. `/round 3.14`\n15. `/rand (round=round|ceil|floor from=number=0 to=number=1)` \u2013 returns a random number between from and to, e.g. `/rand` or `/rand 10` or `/rand from=5 to=10`. Ranges are inclusive. The returned value will contain a fractional part. Use `round` named argument to get an integral value, e.g. `/rand round=ceil` to round up, `round=floor` to round down, and `round=round` to round to nearest.\n\n### Example 1: get an area of a circle with a radius of 50.\n\n```stscript\n/setglobalvar key=PI 3.1415 |\n/setvar key=r 50 |\n/mul r r PI |\n/round |\n/echo Circle area: {{pipe}}\n```\n\n### Example 2: calculate a factorial of 5.\n\n```stscript\n/setvar key=input 5 |\n/setvar key=i 1 |\n/setvar key=product 1 |\n/while left=i right=input rule=lte \"/mul product i \\| /setvar key=product \\| /addvar key=i 1\" |\n/getvar product |\n/echo Factorial of {{getvar::input}}: {{pipe}} |\n/flushvar input |\n/flushvar i |\n/flushvar product\n```\n\n## Using the LLM\n\nScripts can make requests to your currently connected LLM API using the following commands:\n\n- `/gen (prompt)` \u2014 generates text using the provided prompt for the selected character and including chat messages.\n- `/genraw (prompt)` \u2014 generates text using just the provided prompt, ignoring the current character and chat.\n- `/trigger` \u2014 triggers a normal generation (equivalent to clicking a \"Send\" button). If in group chat, you can optionally provide a 1-based group member index or a character name to have them reply, otherwise triggers a group round according to the group settings.\n\n### Arguments for `/gen` and `/genraw`\n\n```stscript\n/genraw lock=on/off stop=[] instruct=on/off (prompt)\n```\n\n- `lock` \u2014 can be `on` or `off`. Specifies whether a user input should be blocked while the generation is in progress. Default: `off`.\n- `stop` \u2014 JSON-serialized array of strings. Adds a custom stop string (if the API supports it) just for this generation. Default: none.\n- `instruct` (only `/genraw`) \u2014 can be `on` or `off`. Allows to use instruct formatting on the input prompt (if instruct mode is enabled and the API supports it). Set to `off` to force pure prompts. Default: `on`.\n- `as` (for Text Completion APIs) \u2014 can be `system` (default) or `char`. Defines how the last prompt line will be formatted. `char` will use a character name, `system` will use no or neutral name.\n\nThe generated text is then passed through the pipe to the next command and can be saved to a variable or displaced using the I/O capabilities:\n\n```stscript\n/genraw Write a funny message from Cthulhu about taking over the world. Use emojis. |\n/popup <h3>Cthulhu says:</h3><div>{{pipe}}</div>\n```\n\n|---------------------------------------------------|\n\nor to insert the generated message as a response from your character:\n\n```stscript\n/genraw You have been memory wiped, your name is now Lisa and you're tearing me apart. You're tearing me apart Lisa! |\n/sendas name={{char}} {{pipe}}\n```\n\n## Temporal character\n\nIf you are not in a group chat, scripts may temporarily make a request to the currently connected LLM as a different character.\n\n- `/ask (prompt)` \u2014 generates text using the provided prompt for a specified character and including chat messages. Please note that swipes of the response from this character will revert back to the current character.\n\n```stscript\n/ask name=... (prompt)\n```\n### Arguments for `/ask`\n\n- `name` \u2014 **Required**. The name of the character to ask (or a unique character identifier, such as an avatar key). This must be provided as a named argument.\n- `return` \u2014 Specifies how the return value should be provided. Defaults to `pipe` (output via the command pipe). Other options can be specified if supported by the API.\n\n```stscript\n/ask name=Alice What is your favorite color?\n```\n\n## Prompt injections\n\nScripts can add custom LLM prompt injections, making it essentially an equivalent of unlimited Author's Notes.\n\n- `/inject (text)` \u2014 inserts any text into the normal LLM prompt for the current chat, and requires a unique identifier. Saved to chat metadata.\n- `/listinjects` \u2014 shows a list of all prompt injections added by scripts for the current chat in a system message.\n- `/flushinjects` \u2014 deletes all prompt injections added by scripts for the current chat.\n- `/note (text)` \u2014 sets the Author's Note value for the current chat. Saved to chat metadata.\n- `/interval` \u2014 sets the Author's Note insertion interval for the current chat.\n- `/depth` \u2014 sets the Author's Note insertion depth for the in-chat position.\n- `/position`  \u2014 sets the Author's Note position for the current chat.\n\n### Arguments for `/inject`\n\n```stscript\n/inject id=IdGoesHere position=chat depth=4 My prompt injection\n```\n\n- `id` \u2014 an identifier string or a reference to a variable. Consequent calls of `/inject` with the same ID will overwrite the previous text injection. **Required argument.**\n- `position` \u2014 sets a position for the injection. Default: `after`. Possible values:\n  - `after`: after the main prompt.\n  - `before`: before main prompt.\n  - `chat`: in-chat.\n- `depth` \u2014 sets an injection depth for the in-chat position. 0 means insertion after the last message, 1 - before the last message, etc. Default: 4.\n- Unnamed argument is a text to be injected. An empty string will unset the previous value for the provided identifier.\n\n## Access chat messages\n\n### Read messages\n\nYou can access messages in the currently selected chat using the `/messages` command.\n\n```stscript\n/messages names=on/off start-finish\n```\n\n- The `names` argument is used to specify whether you want to include character names or not, default: `on`.\n- In an unnamed argument, it accepts a message index or range in the `start-finish` format. Ranges are inclusive!\n- If the range is unsatisfiable, i.e. an invalid index or more messages than exist are requested, then an empty string is returned.\n- Messages that are hidden from the prompt (denoted by the ghost icon) are excluded from the output.\n- If you want to know the index of the latest message, use the `{{lastMessageId}}` macro, and `{{lastMessage}}` will get you the message itself.\n\nTo calculate the start index for a range, for example, when you need to get the last N messages, use variable subtraction.\nThis example will get you 3 last messages in the chat:\n\n```stscript\n/setvar key=start {{lastMessageId}} |\n/addvar key=start -2 |\n/messages names=off {{getvar::start}}-{{lastMessageId}} |\n/setinput\n```\n\n### Send messages\n\nA script can send messages as either a user, character, persona, neutral narrator, or add comments.\n\n1. `/send (text)` \u2014 adds a message as the currently selected persona.\n2. `/sendas name=charname (text)` \u2014 adds a message as any character, matching by their name. `name` argument is required. Use the `{{char}}` macro to send as the current character.\n3. `/sys (text)` \u2014 adds a message from the neutral narrator that doesn't belong to the user or character. The displayed name is purely cosmetic and can be customized with the `/sysname` command.\n4. `/comment (text)` \u2014 adds a hidden comment that is displayed in the chat but is not visible to the prompt.\n5. `/addswipe (text)` \u2014 adds a swipe to the last character message. Can't add a swipe to the user or hidden messages.\n6. `/hide (message id or range)` \u2014 hides one or several messages from the prompt based on the provided message index or inclusive range in the `start-finish` format.\n7. `/unhide (message id or range)` \u2014 returns one or several messages to the prompt based on the provided message index or inclusive range in the `start-finish` format.\n\n`/send`, `/sendas`, `/sys`, and `/comment` commands optionally accept a named argument `at` with a zero-based numeric value (or a variable name that contains such a value) that specifies an exact position of message insertion. By default new messages are inserted at the end of the chat log.\n\nThis will insert a user message at the beginning of the conversation history:\n\n```stscript\n/send at=0 Hi, I use Linux.\n```\n\n### Delete messages\n\n**These commands are potentially destructive and have no \"undo\" function. Check the /backups/ folder if you accidentally deleted something important.**\n\n1. `/cut (message id or range)` \u2014 cuts one or several messages from the chat based on the provided message index or inclusive range in the `start-finish` format.\n2. `/del (number)` \u2014 deletes last N messages from the chat.\n3. `/delswipe (1-based swipe id)` \u2014 deletes a swipe from the last character message based on the provided 1-based swipe ID.\n4. `/delname (character name)` \u2014 deletes all messages in the current chat that belong to a character with the specified name.\n5. `/delchat` \u2014 deletes the current chat.\n\n## World Info commands\n\nWorld Info (also known as Lorebook) is a highly utilitarian tool for dynamically inserting data into the prompt. See the dedicated page for more detailed explanation: [World Info](SillyTavern_Usage_worldinfo.md).\n\n1. `/getchatbook` \u2013 gets a name of the chat-bound World Info file or create a new one if was unbound, and pass it down the pipe.\n2. `/findentry file=bookName field=fieldName [text]` \u2013 finds a UID of the record from the specified file (or a variable pointing to a file name) using fuzzy matching of a field value with the provided text (default field: `key`) and passes the UID down the pipe, e.g. `/findentry file=chatLore field=key Shadowfang`.\n3. `/getentryfield file=bookName field=field [UID]` \u2013 gets a field value (default field: `content`) of the record with the UID from the specified World Info file (or a variable pointing to a file name) and passes the value down the pipe, e.g. `/getentryfield file=chatLore field=content 123`.\n4. `/setentryfield file=bookName uid=UID field=field [text]` \u2013 sets a field value (default field: `content`) of the record with the UID (or a variable pointing to UID) from the specified World Info file (or a variable pointing to a file name). To set multiple values for key fields, use a comma-delimited list as a text value, e.g. `/setentryfield file=chatLore uid=123 field=key Shadowfang,sword,weapon`.\n5. `/createentry file=bookName key=keyValue [content text]` \u2013 creates a new record in the specified file  (or a variable pointing to a file name) with the key and content (both of these arguments are *optional*) and passes the UID down the pipe, e.g. `/createentry file=chatLore key=Shadowfang The sword of the king`.\n\n### Valid entry fields\n\n| Field              | UI element        | Value type      |\n|:-------------------|:------------------|:----------------|\n| `content`          | Content           | String          |\n| `comment`          | Title / Memo      | String          |\n| `key`              | Primary Keywords  | List of strings |\n| `keysecondary`     | Optional Filter   | List of strings |\n| `constant`         | Constant Status   | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `disable`          | Disabled Status   | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `order`            | Order             | Number          |\n| `selectiveLogic`   | Logic             | (see below)     |\n| `excludeRecursion` | Non-recursable    | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `probability`      | Trigger%          | Number (0-100)  |\n| `depth`            | Depth             | Number (0-999)  |\n| `position`         | Position          | (see below)     |\n| `role`             | Depth Role        | (see below)     |\n| `scanDepth`        | Scan Depth        | Number (0-100)  |\n| `caseSensitive`    | Case-Sensitive    | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `matchWholeWords`  | Match Whole Words | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `vectorized`       | Vectorized Status | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `automationId`     | Automation ID     | String          |\n| `group`            | Inclusion Group   | String          |\n| `groupOverride`    | Inclusion Group Prioritize | Boolean (1/0) |\n| `groupWeight`      | Inclusion Group Weight | Number (0-100) |\n| `useGroupScoring`  | Group Scoring     | Boolean (1/0)   |\n| `characterFilterExclude` | Character Filter Exclude Mode | List of strings |\n| `characterFilterNames` | Character Filter Names | List of strings |\n| `characterFilterTags` | Character Filter Tags | List of strings |\n| `matchCharacterDepthPrompt` | Match Character Depth Prompt | Boolean (1/0) |\n| `matchCharacterDescription` | Match Character Description | Boolean (1/0) |\n| `matchCharacterPersonality` | Match Character Personality | Boolean (1/0) |\n| `matchCreatorNotes` | Match Creator Notes | Boolean (1/0) |\n| `matchPersonaDescription` | Match Persona Description | Boolean (1/0) |\n| `matchScenario` | Match Scenario | Boolean (1/0) |\n\n**Logic values**\n\n- 0 = AND ANY\n- 1 = NOT ALL\n- 2 = NOT ANY\n- 3 = AND ALL\n\n**Position values**\n\n- 0 = before main prompt\n- 1 = after main prompt\n- 2 = top of Author's Note\n- 3 = bottom of Author's Note\n- 4 = in-chat at depth\n- 5 = top of example messages\n- 6 = bottom of example messages\n\n**Role values** (Position = 4 only)\n- 0 = System\n- 1 = User\n- 2 = Assistant\n\n### Example 1: Read a content from the chat lorebook by key\n\n```stscript\n/getchatbook | /setvar key=chatLore |\n/findentry file={{getvar::chatLore}} field=key Shadowfang |\n/getentryfield file={{getvar::chatLore}} field=key |\n/echo\n```\n\n### Example 2: Create a chat lorebook entry with key and content\n\n```stscript\n/getchatbook | /setvar key=chatLore |\n/createentry file={{getvar::chatLore}} key=\"Milla\" Milla Basset is a friend of Lilac and Carol.

Incorporate existing information into your reply: {{getvar::millaContent}} |\n/setvar key=millaContent |\n/echo New content: {{pipe}} |\n/setentryfield file={{getvar::chatLore}} uid=millaUid field=content {{getvar::millaContent}}\n```\n\n## Text manipulation\n\nThere's a variety of useful text manipulation utility commands to be used in various script scenarios.\n\n1. `/trimtokens` \u2014 trims the input to the specified number of text tokens from the start or from the end and outputs the result to the pipe.\n2. `/trimstart` \u2014 trims the input to the start of the first complete sentence and outputs the result to the pipe.\n3. `/trimend` \u2014 trims the input to the end of the last complete sentence and outputs the result to the pipe.\n4. `/fuzzy` \u2014 performs fuzzy matching of the input text to the list of strings, outputting the best string match to the pipe.\n5. `/regex name=scriptName [text]` \u2014 executes a regex script from the Regex extension for the specified text. The script must be enabled.\n\n### Arguments for `/trimtokens`\n\n```stscript\n/trimtokens limit=number direction=start/end (input)\n```\n\n1. `direction` sets the direction for trimming, which can be either `start` or `end`. Default: `end`.\n2. `limit` sets the amount of tokens to left in the output. Can also specify a variable name containing the number. **Required argument.**\n3. Unnamed argument is the input text to be trimmed.\n\n### Arguments for `/fuzzy`\n\n```stscript\n/fuzzy list=[\"candidate1\",\"candidate2\"] (input)\n```\n\n1. `list` is a JSON-serialized array of strings containing the candidates. Can also specify a variable name containing the list. **Required argument.**\n2. Unnamed argument is the input text to be matched. Output is one of the candidates matching the input most closely.\n\n## Autocomplete\n\n- Autocomplete is enabled both on the chat input, and the large Quick Reply editor.\n- Autocomplete works anywhere in your input. Even with multiple piped commands and nested closures.\n- Autocomplete supports three ways of looking up matching commands (*User Settings* -> *STscript Matching*).\n\n1. **Starts with** The \"old\" way. Only commands that begin exactly with the typed value will show up.\n2. **Includes**  All commands that *include* the type value will show up. Example: When entering `/delete`, the commands `/qr-delete` and `/qr-set-delete` will show up in the autocomplete list (/qr-**delete**, /qr-set-**delete**).\n3. **Fuzzy**  All commands that can be fuzzy-matched against the typed value will show up. Example: When entering `/seas`, the command `/sendas` will show up in the autocomplete list (/**se**nd**as**).\n\n- Command arguments are supported by autocomplete as well. The list will show up for required arguments automatically. For optional arguments, press *Ctrl*+*Space* to open the list of available options.\n- When entering `/:` to execute a closure or QR, autocomplete will show a list of scoped variables and QRs.\n- Autocomplete has limited support for macros (in slash commands). Type `{{` to get a list of available macros.\n- Use the *up* and *down* *arrow keys* to select an option from the list of autocomplete options.\n- Press *Enter* or *Tab* or *click* on an option to place the option at the cursor.\n- Press *Escape* to close the autocomplete list.\n- Press *Ctrl*+*Space* to open the autocomplete list or toggle the selected option's details.\n\n## Parser Flags\n\n```stscript\n/parser-flag\n```\n\nThe parser accepts flags to modify its behavior. These flags can be toggled on and off at any point in a script and all following input will be evaluated accordingly.  \nYou can set your default flags in user settings.\n\n### Strict Escaping\n\n```stscript\n/parser-flag STRICT_ESCAPING on |\n```\n\nChanges with `STRICT_ESCAPING` enabled are as follows.\n\n#### Pipes\n\nPipes don't need to be escaped in quoted values.\n\n```stscript\n/echo title=\"a|b\" c\\|d\n```\n\n#### Backslashes\n\nA backslash in front of a symbol can be escaped to provide the literal backslash followed by the functional symbol.\n\n```stscript\n// this will echo \"foo \\\", then echo \"bar\" |\n/echo foo \\\\|\n/echo bar\n```\n\n```stscript\n/echo \\\\|\n/echo \\\\\\|\n```\n\n### Replace Variable Macros\n\n```stscript\n/parser-flag REPLACE_GETVAR on |\n```\n\nThis flag helps to avoid double-substitutions when the variable values contain text that could be interpreted as macros. The `{{var::}}` macros get substituted last and no further substitutions happen on the resulting text / variable value.\n\nReplaces all `{{getvar::}}` and `{{getglobalvar::}}` macros with `{{var::}}`.\nBehind the scenes, the parser will insert a series of command executors before the command with the replaced macros:\n\n- call `/let` to save the current `{{pipe}}` to a scoped variable\n- call `/getvar` or `/getglobalvar` to get the variable used in the macro\n- call `/let` to save the retrieved variable to a scoped variable\n- call `/return` with the saved `{{pipe}}` value to restore the correct piped value for the next command\n\n```stscript\n// the following will echo the last message's id / number |\n/setvar key=x \\{\\{lastMessageId}} |\n/echo {{getvar::x}}\n```\n\n```stscript\n// this will echo the literal text {{lastMessageId}} |\n/parser-flag REPLACE_GETVAR |\n/setvar key=x \\{\\{lastMessageId}} |\n/echo {{getvar::x}}\n```\n\n## Quick Replies: script library and auto-execution\n\nQuick Replies is a built-in SillyTavern extension that provides an easy way to store and execute your scripts.\n\n### Configuring Quick Replies\n\nIn order to get started, enable open the extensions panel (stacked blocks icon), and expand the Quick Replies menu.\n\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:center\">\n\n</div>\n\n**Quick Replies are disabled by default, you need to enable them first.** Then you will see a bar appearing above your chat input bar.\n\nYou can set the displayed button text label (we recommend using emojis for brevity) and the script that will be executed when you click the button.\n\nThe number of buttons is controlled by the **Number of slots** settings (max = 100), adjust it according to your needs and click \"Apply\" when done.\n\n**Inject user input automatically** recommended to be disabled when using STscript, otherwise it may interfere with your inputs, use the `{{input}}` macro to get the current value of the input bar in scripts instead.\n\n**Quick Reply presets** allow to have multiple sets of predefined Quick Replies and switch between manually or by using the `/qrset (name of set)` command.\nDon't forget to click \"Update\" before switching to a different set to write your changes to the currently used preset!\n\n### Manual execution\n\nNow you can add your first script to the library. Pick any free slot (or create one), type \"Click me\" into the left box to set the label, then paste this into the right box:\n\n```stscript\n/addvar key=clicks 1 |\n/if left=clicks right=5 rule=eq else=\"/echo Keep going...\" \"/echo You did it!  \\| /flushvar clicks\"\n```\n\nThen click 5 times on the button that appeared above the chat bar.\nEvery click increments the variable `clicks` by one and displays a different message when the value equals 5 and resets the variable.\n\n### Automatic execution\n\nOpen the modal menu by clicking the `\u22ee` button for the created command.\n\n|---------------------------------------------------------|\n\nIn this menu you can do the following:\n\n- Edit the script in a convenient full-screen editor\n- Hide the button from the chat bar, making it accessible only for auto-execution.\n- Enable automatic execution on one or more of the following conditions:\n  * App startup\n  * Sending a user message to the chat\n  * Receiving an AI message in the chat\n  * Opening a character or group chat\n  * Triggering a reply from a group member\n  * Activating a World Info entry using the same Automation ID\n- Provide a custom tool tip for the quick reply (text displayed when hovering over the quick reply in your UI)\n- Execute the script for test purposes\n\nCommands are executed automatically only if the Quick Replies extension is enabled.\n\nFor example, you can display a message after sending five user messages by adding the following script and setting it to auto-execute on the user message.\n\n```stscript\n/addvar key=usercounter 1 |\n/echo You've sent {{pipe}} messages. |\n/if left=usercounter right=5 rule=gte \"/echo Game over! \\| /flushvar usercounter\"\n```\n\n### Debugger\n\nA basic debugger exists inside the expanded Quick Reply editor. Set breakpoints with `/breakpoint |` anywhere in your script. When executing the script from the QR editor, the execution will be interrupted at that point, allowing you to examine the currently available variables, pipe, command arguments, and more, and to step through the rest of the code one by one.\n\n```stscript\n/let x {: n=1\n\t/echo n is {{var::n}} |\n\t/mul n n |\n:} |\n/breakpoint |\n/:x n=3 |\n/echo result is {{pipe}} |\n```\n\n|--------------------------------------------------------|\n\n### Calling procedures\n\nA `/run` command can call scripts defined in the Quick Replies by their label, basically providing the ability to define procedures and return results from them. This allows to have reusable script blocks that other scripts could reference. The last result from the procedure's pipe is passed to the next command after it.\n\n```stscript\n/run ScriptLabel\n```\n\nLet's create two Quick Replies:\n\n***\n**Label:**\n\n`GetRandom`\n\n**Command:**\n\n```stscript\n/pass {{roll:d100}}\n```\n***\n**Label:**\n\n`GetMessage`\n\n**Command:**\n```stscript\n/run GetRandom | /echo Your lucky number is: {{pipe}}\n```\n***\n\nClicking on the `GetMessage` button will call the `GetRandom` procedure which will resolve the `{{roll}}` macro and pass the number to the caller, displaying it to the user.\n\n- Procedures do not accept named or unnamed arguments, but can reference the same variables as the caller.\n- Avoid recursion when calling procedures as it may produce the \"call stack exceeded\" error if handled unadvisedly.\n\n#### Calling procedures from a different Quick Reply preset\n\nYou can call a procedure from a different quick reply preset using the `a.b` syntax, where a = QR preset name and b = QR label name\n\n```stscript\n/run QRpreset1.QRlabel1\n```\n\nBy default, the system will first look for a quick reply label `a.b`, so if one of your labels is literally \"QRpreset1.QRlabel1\" it will try to run that. If no such label is found, it will search for a QR preset name \"QRpreset1\" with a QR labeled \"QRlabel1\".\n\n### Quick Replies management commands\n\n#### Create Quick Reply\n\n* `/qr-create (arguments, [message])` \u2013 creates a new Quick Reply, example: `/qr-create set=MyPreset label=MyButton /echo 123`\n\nArguments:\n- `label`    - string - text on the button, e.g., `label=MyButton`\n- `set`      - string - name of the QR set, e.g., `set=PresetName1`\n- `hidden`   - bool   - whether the button should be hidden, e.g., `hidden=true`\n- `startup`  - bool   - auto execute on app startup, e.g., `startup=true`\n- `user`     - bool   - auto execute on user message, e.g., `user=true`\n- `bot`      - bool   - auto execute on AI message, e.g., `bot=true`\n- `load`     - bool   - auto execute on chat load, e.g., `load=true`\n- `title`    - bool   - title / tooltip to be shown on button, e.g., `title=\"My Fancy Button\"`\n\n#### Delete Quick Reply\n\n* `/qr-delete (set=string [label])` \u2013 deletes Quick Reply\n\n#### Update Quick Reply\n\n* `/qr-update (arguments, [message])` \u2013 updates Quick Reply, example: `/qr-update set=MyPreset label=MyButton newlabel=MyRenamedButton /echo 123`\n\nArguments:\n- `newlabel` - string - new text fort the button, e.g. `newlabel=MyRenamedButton`\n- `label`    - string - text on the button, e.g., `label=MyButton`\n- `set`      - string - name of the QR set, e.g., `set=PresetName1`\n- `hidden`   - bool   - whether the button should be hidden, e.g., `hidden=true`\n- `startup`  - bool   - auto execute on app startup, e.g., `startup=true`\n- `user`     - bool   - auto execute on user message, e.g., `user=true`\n- `bot`      - bool   - auto execute on AI message, e.g., `bot=true`\n- `load`     - bool   - auto execute on chat load, e.g., `load=true`\n- `title`    - bool   - title / tooltip to be shown on button, e.g., `title=\"My Fancy Button\"`\n\n####\n\n* `qr-get` - retrieves all of a Quick Reply's properties, eample: `/qr-get set=myQrSet id=42`\n\n#### Create or update QR preset\n\n* `/qr-presetupdate (arguments [label])` or `/qr-presetadd (arguments [label])`\n\nArguments:\n- `enabled` - bool - enable or disable the preset\n- `nosend`  - bool - disable send / insert in user input (invalid for slash commands)\n- `before`  - bool - place QR before user input\n- `slots`   - int  - number of slots\n- `inject`  - bool - inject user input automatically (if disabled use `{{input}}`)\n\nCreate a new preset (overrides existing ones), example: `/qr-presetadd slots=3 MyNewPreset`\n\n#### Add QR context menu\n\n* `/qr-contextadd (set=string label=string chain=bool [preset name])` \u2013 add context menu preset to a QR, example: `/qr-contextadd set=MyPreset label=MyButton chain=true MyOtherPreset`\n\n#### Remove all context menus\n\n* `/qr-contextclear (set=string [label])` \u2013 remove all context menu presets from a QR, example: `/qr-contextclear set=MyPreset MyButton`\n\n#### Remove one context menu\n\n* `/qr-contextdel (set=string label=string [preset name])` \u2013 remove context menu preset from a QR, example: `/qr-contextdel set=MyPreset label=MyButton MyOtherPreset`\n\n### Quick Reply value escaping\n\n`|{}` can be escaped with backslash in the QR message / command.\n\nFor example, use `/qr-create label=MyButton /getvar myvar \\| /echo \\{\\{pipe\\}\\}` to create a QR that calls `/getvar myvar | /echo {{pipe}}`.\n\n## Extension commands\n\nSillyTavern extensions (both built-in, downloadable and third-party) can add their own slash command. Below is just an example of the capabilities in the official extensions. The list may be incomplete, make sure to check `/help slash` for the most complete list of available commands.\n\n1. `/websearch (query)` \u2014 searches snippets of the web pages online for the specified query and returns the result into the pipe. Provided by the Web Search extension.\n2. `/imagine (prompt)` \u2014 generates an image using the provided prompt. Provided by the Image Generation extension.\n3. `/emote (sprite)` \u2014 sets a sprite for the active character by fuzzy matching its name. Provided by the Character Expressions extension.\n4. `/costume (subfolder)` \u2014 sets a sprite set override for the active character. Provided by the Character Expressions extension.\n5. `/music (name)` \u2014 force changes a played background music file by its name. Provided by the Dynamic Audio extension.\n6. `/ambient (name)` \u2014 force changes a played ambient sound file by its name. Provided by the Dynamic Audio extension.\n7. `/roll (dice formula)` \u2014 adds a hidden message to the chat with the result of a dice roll. Provided by the D&D Dice extension.\n\n## UI interaction\n\nScripts can also interact with SillyTavern's UI: navigate through the chats or change styling parameters.\n\n### Character navigation\n\n1. `/random` \u2014 opens a chat with the random character.\n2. `/go (name)` \u2014 opens a chat with the character of the specified name. First, searches for the exact name match, then by a prefix, then by a substring.\n\n### UI styling\n\n1. `/bubble` \u2014 sets the message style to the \"bubble chat\" style.\n2. `/flat` \u2014 sets the message style to the \"flat chat\" style.\n3. `/single` \u2014 sets the message style to the \"single document\" style.\n4. `/movingui (name)` \u2014 activates a MovingUI preset by name.\n5. `/resetui` \u2014 resets the MovingUI panels state to their original positions.\n6. `/panels` \u2014 toggles the UI panels visibility: top bar, left and right drawers.\n7. `/bg (name)` \u2014 finds and sets a background using fuzzy names matching. Respect the chat background lock state.\n8. `/lockbg` \u2014 locks the background image for the current chat.\n9. `/unlockbg` \u2014 unlocks the background image for the current chat.\n\n## More examples\n\n### Generate chat summary (by @IkariDevGIT)\n\n```stscript\n/setglobalvar key=summaryPrompt Summarize the most important facts and events that have happened in the chat given to you in the Input header.
